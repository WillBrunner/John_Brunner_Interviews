I don't know, the relatives are buried there at Lawrence Hill, too.
I think that's one more.
Is this the runner?
Yeah.
Um, I don't know, that's what I'll have to be talking about.
Well, how about when you make your home?
You moved to India.
What about the cucumber?
Well, when we, Paul decided, the government wanted to buy the land, and they tried to
insist that people sell out.
In fonts.
In fonts.
And they wanted to land back to the state, the government.
The government was going to buy it, but later they turned it over to the state.
It's State Forest now.
And so he sold out, and they got Harrigenton.
That was Ralph Denton's brother.
He had a truck.
Ralph Denton was the guy, later my father-in-law.
I tried to marry Evelyn.
I had worked for him a lot later.
Um, so Harry come down there.
We loaded up everything on the truck.
Everything we could.
And he had a pretty big bed on, box on the truck.
And had a horse, and a cow, and household stuff.
And it was loaded.
And, uh, I know Harry, while we was loading it up, he says, I built too big a box from this truck.
And, but he had all loads of horses on it, and so he used to heavy loads, and he had all heavy loads of timber on that thing's truck.
But, anyhow, we finally got it loaded.
And, uh, we started out.
And I was supposed to go with Harry to take care of the stock on the way.
Where was he going?
The horse and the cow, to Indiana.
Why there?
I don't know.
He wanted to go where they had the big red barns.
Well, it was a dumb move.
He should have stayed in Minnesota.
And he realized that afterwards.
He could have owned land in Minnesota, and he never did in Indiana.
Because the place that he agreed to buy, he never could pay for.
The taxes was $200 a year, and that was more than he could make.
And besides the payment, I don't know how much the payment would have been.
It was the Federal Land Bank had got it.
And, uh, they got it just for a loan that somebody borrowed money from them and lost it, lost their place.
When that guy lost it, what made Pa think he could pay for the place and the taxes, too,
when the other guy couldn't even pay the taxes.
Huh.
So, uh, Pa turned it over to somebody else after a couple years, I guess.
I don't know how long.
And, uh, Pa did more for the place than anybody else.
He was fixing up fences and clearing fence lines all the time.
And kept me pretty busy when I wasn't.
A lot of the time, I did get to work out some of the time, but I didn't.
The only thing that benefited me that were working out for the other people was I got fed pretty good.
Uh, better than when I was at home, because Pa would get my wages.
So, when I left Indiana, I only had $11 in my pocket.
And...
How would you do that?
Well, I managed to keep that much.
The guy that I was working for us said,
I'll tell them that you ain't got nothing coming if they come here for money.
Had he paid you to say that?
He had?
He'd give it to me.
No, not always when they'd ask.
He's a pretty good guy.
For us, basically.
Um...
So, you started with Harry, how, like, the truck to feed the truck?
Oh, yeah.
And, uh, on the way, Pa said, don't give him any of that money.
He'd give me the $100 that was supposed to be paid for when we got to Indiana.
Uh, $100 seemed awful cheap to drive a truck to Indiana for a single trip and not have enough to haul back.
Well, I guess $100 is quite a little bit in them days.
That was in...
34?
Or was it 35?
Must have been the spring of 35.
Well, anyhow...
Well, that was a depression, wasn't it?
His, uh, he had a bearing glove, a wheel-bearing glove, on the truck.
And he was, he had it tore down.
He had a guy riding with him.
And, uh, uh, he'd help drive.
This guy would take turns driving, because he was going to drive it straight through.
And, uh, and one could sleep and the other could drive.
And, uh, he, uh, when he broke down, he had to have money for parts.
And, uh, he wanted some money.
Well, Pa said, don't give him any of it until we got down there.
He was scared to dump the truck off somewhere.
He wouldn't have though, would he?
I don't think he would have, no.
Anyhow, I'd give him $40.
And then, when we got down there...
Oh, while they were changing that bearing, that horse, he was...
Oh, what made it so bad, is that when we got loaded up at home,
we drove up to his place, south of Greyston,
and, uh, to sleep.
We loaded at night.
And then we drove up there, and to sleep, and I said, uh,
aren't we going to take the stock off?
He said, oh, no, we couldn't take him off.
He said, that horse wouldn't get back on if you took him off now.
And, so, they were on overnight.
Oh, then it was the next night, when that bearing went out,
and that horse was a paw on the floor of the truck.
Paw and paw and paw, and I couldn't stop him from pawing.
I'd get up there with him, and I'd tell him to quit,
and he'd quit for a little, and I'd pet him, and he'd tell him to quit,
and talk to him, and he'd start pawing.
He said he was going to paw through that floor.
Is that the same big horse, Dan?
Yeah.
And he said, I said, uh, you can't paw through that floor, can you?
He said, it's only single floor.
And, you know how a horse is on a single floor inch lumber?
You know, well, it's a sod inch.
It ain't like, it's plain lumber.
Uh, I'd have put a two-inch floor in at any house.
So, generally, it turns, uh, you know,
I don't believe it's a single floor in a truck.
Huh.
And, although I did move that.
You did?
Yeah, I used a single floor.
I saw it, and, um, I was going to trust you to help.
We held horses, and.
Huh.
Um, I heard it in a song.
I said, I have to have you a single floor.
Um, we got down to Indiana, and, uh, got the stock unloaded.
And, uh, that same day, his paw came.
But, uh, till he came, I was around the place where we were going to rent.
Till he could get in our house.
Cause he couldn't get in till later.
Uh, in the, in the fall of the year.
He wouldn't, didn't get off to us.
And so he rented a house.
And right after we rented him, uh,
he had turned the horse loose in the, in a fence there.
And she was kind of a yard fence around the barn.
And it just must have been pretty poor because he got out of it.
Get out of it.
And went and run.
And boy, was he happy to be out free.
Cause he was a range horse anyhow.
Uh, well I went and I caught him.
Cause I could walk up to him and catch him wherever he was.
Uh, caught him and.
Cause he don't, I didn't leave the haul truck.
And I just had to take him the haul truck.
But I could leave him just for holding on to his name and just let him.
With my hand along by his jaw.
Hmm.
And.
Took him back.
And then.
Later.
He bought a.
Where were my mules?
He bought a team of mules.
They might have been good mules in their day, but I met a guy afterwards that recognized
them mules and he said they were 30 years old.
And here he, he bought that team of mules for what he could have bought a good horse.
And a good horse would have been way better than, uh, that team of mules.
Uh.
Uh.
Uh.
Uh.
It was dumb.
And.
Uh.
Uh.
I rode, rode one home and led the other one.
And got him home.
The next day after we got him home.
Let's hook up them mules and go get a load of wood.
So, it was four miles from where we was living to the place that he bought.
Well, it would have been five miles to where we got the wood.
Because the place was a mile long.
It was a dumb place to buy.
Eighty acres stretched out for a mile.
In two different townships.
Uh.
There was a road divided.
Uh.
There was, some of it was off on the other side of that road, about fifteen acres.
And the rest of it was, it was just scattered out.
And, uh, so, uh, we hooked him up and drove over there.
And then he said, let's haul that corn fodder first.
We had, we had cut the corn fodder on that place.
The, the, the owner, actually the owner owned the corn.
But we, we'd have half the crop.
Just the Irish corn.
But he said we could go ahead and cut some corn.
And had the fodder.
So, I, uh, we went, we had cut it and shot it.
And then, so we, he wanted it hauled, uh, off the field.
Because, uh, so that they could go ahead and plow the field whenever they wanted it.
He wanted, he wanted it, he wanted it off that field.
So we hauled it off the field.
And then we went down there and we cut a couple of trees, oak trees, in the woods.
That was the only woods that was on this place outside of just a few trees around the house.
And, um, butternut tree in the field.
But, this was a, had been all woods down there, across on there, across the road in that other township.
All there was a field over, over there too.
But, it was a nice little patch of woods.
Anyhow, we cut a couple of trees, I mean, loaded them on the wagon.
No, we didn't.
Yeah, a couple of trees and loaded them on the wagon.
Why didn't he stay there that long?
He, he left.
Maybe he went back to get Laura.
I don't know why he did, why he didn't stay there and drive them mules.
But, anyhow, we loaded, Clarence and I loaded the, uh, wood onto this wagon.
And, a couple of trees.
And, so it made a pretty good layer of wood on the, on this hay rack.
And, here the field was kind of, the edge of the field where we were driving along was kind of wet.
And, the mules stopped, to rest.
The wagon was cutting down aways, in the, in the soft ground.
And, I let them rest a little.
And then they didn't want to pull.
The mules were kind of stubborn anyway.
And, I coaxed them and that didn't work.
And, so, I took the stick to them.
And, I whacked them some.
Not even trying to make them pull.
I just held onto the lines and, and whacked them.
And, then I told them to go.
And, I had Clarence behind the wheel and the wagon, lifting on the back wheel.
That's the best way to roll the wagon.
Rather than push on the wagon, lift on the wheel.
Oh.
Roll the wheel.
Yeah.
And, uh, I had him in, at the wheel.
And, I told them to go.
And, they took off and went out of that field.
And, to the road.
And, I let them rest a little before we went on.
And, it took, uh.
See, that had been five miles from where we went.
And, it took a long time to get home.
The mules was tired.
And, you know, our old, old, old age, they get tired.
And, uh, that was the only thing we used that one mule for.
He got down in the barn sometime after that.
Not, not right away.
It wasn't that that got him down.
He couldn't get up.
And, my dad went out and shot him.
And, Laura hollered at him,
Don't you shoot that new home!
And, he wasn't no good.
Uh, neither of them was good.
But, we did work the other one.
Uh, the Jamie mule.
We worked here for quite long.
I don't know how long, how many years she lasted.
Do I have to work here?
Well, you just bought the thing and then shoot it.
Did they ever fight with each other?
Not actual blows.
No, never come to actual blows.
The nearest, nearest, coming to that, was one time she was hauling at him.
And, I don't know what she was hauling about him for it.
But, she only took a little bit for her to start hauling.
And, she was going around slapping her hand.
She said, if you want to do anything about it, crack a head!
And, on and on and on.
I don't know how many times she said that.
And, he says, I'll crack you!
And, he walked up to her.
And, she, right away, she was scared.
She was, you should have scared her before.
He set her up.
She, you, she could, she could be scared.
And, at one time, it was kind of a rainy day.
And, we were just hanging around, not doing anything around the house.
And, uh, Clarence was standing up on the porch rail.
This was after we got over to our place today.
The one he was going to buy.
Uh, and, Lana wanted to get up.
And, he put his foot in Lana's face and pushed her back down.
And, uh, a lot away from the, uh, banister.
And, Laura had seen him do it.
And, she says, you kicked her!
You kicked her right in the face!
And, she kept on and on and on screaming.
And, the neighbors come around.
And, they lived up the road.
Uh, 150.
Oh, more than, uh, more than 150 yards up the road.
Uh, there, Mandy's wife come to run down there.
And, she was still screaming and hollering.
And, uh, Clarence was going to get a drink of water.
She had gone out in the yard and was going to get, the pump was in the yard there.
They didn't have running water there.
And, uh, he was there at the pump.
So, he was pretty much just ignoring her?
She come out there and still hollering.
You kicked her.
You kicked my baby in the face.
And, he says, yes, and I'll kick you too.
He left the pump.
And, the sidewalk was, they didn't have a sidewalk there.
The sidewalk was wet.
And, he kicked out of her.
And, was going to kick her.
And, his other foot slipped and he just fell right under her.
And, he just slid right under me.
Smoking up hands like that.
She could have kicked him in the face.
But, she didn't.
She was scared.
She was scared.
She was scared.
What happened?
Was he probably pretty big, I think.
That hushed her up.
He was seventeen.
So, she could get scared.
What was Lana built like?
Oh, she was always little, kinda.
She was?
Yeah.
I mean, not Lana.
Laura.
Oh, Laura.
Oh, she was just tall as tall.
Taller when she got older.
Yeah, when she got older, she was taller again.
Bigger, round.
She started shrinking and she skipped growing.
Hey, that's kind of like you, isn't it?
A long time, they were at our site.
We were wasting this.
Keep talking, so.
Well, anyway.
I was in bed.
I had to hear that.
I knew the word.
And, my mother had kept them over there.
But, them and Lana stayed.
They stayed at my mother's.
And, they'd given her some money.
And, she made, she didn't want money.
So, she gave it back to his pop.
And, when they got in our place, uh, we came in the house.
And, the other people that were in the corner.
And, they were all over the other corner.
And, they were all over.
Handed it over.
Handed it over.
Did he?
Yeah.
Handed it over.
And, she just powered over it.
I mean, she just walked in after him.
And, she was like his baby.
Did they stay married?
Till one of them died?
Yeah.
Till he died.
Huh.
Amazing.
Okay.
Well.
And, then what happened from, from out in the, oh, you got to run away from home.
The pickle business.
Well.
How long do you want to run this?
Well.
I guess.
Are you tired of talking?
No.
Um.
I'll watch it close.
Oh.
Uh.
There was a Heinz Pickle Factory.
We'd buy pickles there in, uh, Indiana.
And, tomatoes.
Uh.
Oh.
They'd buy squash and other things too.
There was a cannon factory there.
They had the cannon factory right in the Royal Center.
The town there.
Is it where they got the mail from?
And, uh.
Plus, we'll plant a couple acres of pickles.
So, we went out there and measured off.
Two acres.
And, uh.
He plowed it.
He bought, had bought an old sulky plow.
Sulky is one you can ride on.
And, uh.
It takes three horses to pull it.
It's a single, it was a single bottom plow.
And, uh.
He got three of them, uh, hooked onto it.
A mule.
He had bought a blind horse.
He bought a blind horse.
He bought a blind horse.
And, uh.
We had Dan and, and the mule.
And, uh.
He hooked up onto this sulky plow.
And he plowed it.
And then, uh.
Uh.
I, I measured off.
Pickles and rows.
And planted.
Planted them.
And, uh.
Planted them.
And, uh.
When they were.
They come up.
I, I thinned them.
Cause you thin them to two, two stalks to the hill.
And, uh.
And, uh.
And then, uh.
When they were.
They come up.
I, I thinned them.
Cause you thin them to two, two stalks to the hill.
And, uh.
And, uh.
And then, uh.
We.
When they got ready to pick.
And help pick.
We'd pick, uh.
Half the patch.
Each a day.
One day we'd pick half the patch.
And, uh.
And then, uh.
We.
When they got ready to pick.
And help pick.
We'd pick, uh.
Half the patch.
Each a day.
One day we'd pick half the patch.
And next day we'd pick the other half.
And we'd be all done all the time.
And they still got ahead of us.
We'd have a little, a bigger, paper pickles.
And, uh.
Paper pickles.
Could be.
Company.
Huh.
Well, they're human.
That's it.
Mini.
Mush.
Alright.
One day we'd pick half the patch.
And next day we'd pick the other half.
The end.
And we'd be all done all the time.
And they still got ahead of us.
With the way bigger, paper pickles than the company were.
The company wouldn't take them at all.
We had a mountain of pickles there that they wouldn't use.
You'd have to pick them off the vines or they'd kill the vines.
The vines would quit if you get, pick up.
Pickles and get big on it.
And.
So we sell pickles. Well, we didn't get, they'd have different grades of them, and we never did get very many in number one grade. And so that he didn't make any money off them pickles.
Well, he'd made a little money, but he'd have made so much more if he'd had even a fourth of a half an acre. He would have made more than he would have off that whole thing because we could have picked it closer and got all the number one pickles.
And we couldn't even keep up with him. He hired a kid there to come help him sometime. Just for one day.
And he paid him, he paid that kid a dollar, and I never, and here I'd be paying, giving my money to him that I'd be making. Otherwise.
And expect me to pay for the help of the boy. Well, one day, come a rain, and we weren't picking pickles even, and we were in the bedroom, Clarence and I was, and it was raining outside,
and Paula, and Paula, and Laura knew that Clarence had $3.00, that he had worked and got money somewhere.
And Laura told her, Clarence, told Paula, get that money from Clarence. So he, he's doing his duty, and he'd come in there in his bedroom and said,
I want that $3.00. And Clarence wouldn't give it to him. So he was going to whip Clarence, and so they fought, and they fought, and they fought,
and they fought on the bed and on the floor. And he'd just about get Clarence, because actually he was stronger than Clarence still then.
And he'd just about get him, or even up, maybe. And he'd say, hold his arm, he told me. And I said, no, it's not my fault.
Boy, that made Paul mad. I said, not my fight, I said. And he'd get up off of him, and, because he was laying on top of him,
but he, Clarence would get a hold of him and roll him over. And, uh, I'd, uh, he'd get up off of him and come warm,
and stepped over to me. And I guess he changed his mind. I guess he figured if he couldn't whip Clarence,
he sure couldn't whip me. And he went right to fight. Oh, well, he was up off of Clarence. Clarence went outside.
And, uh, he went out there after him. And he was in the yard, and still demanding that money. And he was going to kick Clarence.
And when he went to kick him, Clarence grabbed him by the heel, and had him dancing around on one leg, laughing at him.
Boy, that was enough. And people don't like to have you laugh at him. He told him, get off the place.
He said, if you ain't gonna mind, get off of this place. You can leave here. You don't, don't stay here no more.
Clarence says, okay. And he didn't even go in the house to get his jacket. He left.
He was probably glad. He walked, started walking up the road. And, Laura come out and says, there's another one, run him off too!
That's when I should have said yes, and I should have taken off down the road after him.
I waited a couple of months before I left. So Clarence never came back?
Yeah. Um, he walked to a neighbor's. There was 11 miles from there. And it was the night by the time he got there.
And he stopped at this neighbor's place. What time of year was it?
Pickle picking time. It was long in September, maybe. He's probably just happy not to have to pick any more pickles.
Long about September, I suppose. And, uh, this neighbor, he told the neighbor he was leaving home.
He told him to get out. He said, you better stay here with me.
Clarence was going to head off somewhere else. Maybe to Minnesota. I don't know where he was going to go.
And, uh, but if I was going to go to Minnesota, I wouldn't have gone any farther than that railroad.
Waterton. Where I can on the train live. But, um, the guy said he needed some help digging a basement under his house.
He was going to dig a basement. He'd raised the house and was going to put a basement under it and pay Clarence.
He wanted Clarence to help him. So Clarence stayed there and helped him do it. He paid much.
And then, uh, they used to have a free show in town on Wednesday nights, uh, at the theater.
The schoolhouse, they put this free show on. They didn't have a theater.
And the merchants of the town would put this free show on.
That's where the farmers were around there.
And, uh, I used to walk in and go to them. I saw some good movies there.
And, uh, they, uh, he said, let's go to town. Let's go to town to the movies.
So I rode in that time. I didn't have to walk. It was only a mile, mile and a half.
That was by the road. It was only a mile. I mean, straight through the field. So that's what I did.
Uh, so we went in there for the show. And the main reason that him wanted to go to the show,
not so much to see the show picture as it was because Lord didn't go home.
It was to see if we could see Clarence. But he didn't say that.
To see Clarence would be there.
Well, why? Did he want him to come home?
Yeah, he wanted to get him back.
And, uh, but after the show, we went home.
I could see Clarence down ahead of us away.
I mean, in this, uh, uh, what's the shoe school where we went to school?
I mean, where we went to see the picture.
And, uh, he was going home and he said, did you see that farm?
He said, yeah, he was sitting down in front of us.
He said, sure.
Well, I didn't see.
Well then, the next Saturday night, following that, he said, let's go to town.
So we went into town.
So we went into town and, uh, when we were, uh, in town, there's bars in there.
We took past each other on the sidewalk.
But he was with other kids.
Oh, I didn't see him.
He didn't see him.
Walked right by.
And, well then, when we was getting ready to go, uh, I was with Paul when he was walking
on the sidewalk.
I'd just see him walking in and see him past us.
Then, when we left to go, here, there was a whole gang of kids standing in the corner
of the street.
And we were coming around there, went around that corner, and here he was with them kids.
Didn't see him then.
And I didn't find him out.
I imagine he did.
And, uh, that's just quite a turkey.
And, uh, did you see that clown?
Yeah, I'm glad you went by him twice.
I told him.
Well, I didn't see.
Well, finally, he did go down and catch me.
And he made him come back and he brought him back.
I wasn't with him.
Didn't he send the sheriff or somebody after him or something?
No.
Uh-uh.
He was going to send sheriff after me, but he didn't.
Oh.
He didn't send him after Clarence.
So then Clarence came back on the list?
Yeah.
And he stayed there off and on.
He'd work out some, but he'd stay there off and on with him until he went to the Marines.
When he was in the Marines?
Yeah.
And, uh, he'd send his, he'd send money home from the Marines.
For what?
Hoping that they would save it for him.
What's he had?
Yeah.
He'd spend her.
Nothing there.
We'd come home for him.
And he had bought a car before he went.
And he didn't have a car either.
That was their car.
He was using it sometime on a Saturday night.
He was using the car.
He went somewhere around town on a Saturday night.
He didn't get that joke.
Sunday mornings.
He wanted that car to go to church.
Where were you?
We need that car.
We need that car.
We need that car.
We need that car.
We need that car before he went.
And he didn't have a car either.
That was their car.
He was using it sometime on a Saturday night.
He was using the car.
He went somewhere around town on a Saturday night.
He didn't get that joke.
Sunday mornings.
He said, here they need watered that car to go to church.
Where were you?
We need that car.
So then when did you leave home?
How about that?
And how come?
What made you decide?
I told Pa I was going to leave before I left.
He says, where are you going?
And I was thinking of going to Texas.
Because my grandfather lived in Texas.
My mother's father lived in Texas with his second family.
And, uh, well, they were all gone by that time.
But then he had raised his second family in Texas.
And, uh, a league city.
And, uh, I, uh, thought of going to see him.
Because I'd never met him.
And, uh, I told Pa I was going to leave.
And he said, where are you going?
And I said, Texas.
Do you know somebody there?
And I said, no.
What do you want to go to Texas for?
Uh, uh, to see the country.
And, uh, uh, if you do, I'll send the sheriff after you.
Because they could, right?
So you were twenty-one.
He told me I belonged to him until I was twenty-one.
And I was still twenty.
And, uh, my money was all his until twenty-one.
Well, he figured the same thing with Bill.
When Bill was, went into mines, he was, the school teacher ran him out of school.
I remember that.
And, uh, so, uh, when, uh, because he wouldn't let the school teacher catch up to him to beat
him over something he didn't do, uh, he ran him out of school.
And so Foster says, well, you can go in the mine, working.
So he got a job in the mine, and he was working with a one-armed black guy.
He was the only one-armed guy right around that town, around that country.
The only black guy.
Well, he worked at that mine, and so he got a job.
He was helping that one-armed man, and he didn't get a third.
He would get a third of the coal they loaded.
Uh, the other guy got the most because he was teaching him how.
And, uh, back in them days, he was just a slave to the coal company.
And, uh, so he went into mine.
And when he'd come home, he'd give his paycheck, I mean, they paid him cash.
He'd give the money to Paul.
Well, Paul would give him a couple dollars back.
But that's all.
Well, later, even Elmer was going to get married.
And, uh, he was still twenty.
And, uh, see, when he went into mine, he was sixteen, yes.
I think he was sixteen years old.
And he'd been given for his wages all this time.
And then he and Elmer, they borrowed my Aunt Sarah's car.
She had a twenty-eight Chevy, a new twenty-eight Chevy.
And they drove down to West Virginia because she could get married underage down in West Virginia.
Who was underage?
Yeah.
And he left the bill.
He was twenty.
You weren't allowed to get married under twenty-eight?
No.
Uh, I don't know what she did have to do.
How?
Well, Elmer was twenty-eight?
She was twenty-one.
Oh.
He was twenty.
Thereabouts.
She was a year and a half older than I think.
Hmm.
Anyhow, we borrowed her car, drove down to West Virginia, and got married.
But she was not married.
And didn't tell anybody.
Uh, and, uh, so far, Bill was still sleeping with me at home.
And he was married?
Yeah.
And she was sleeping at her hip-hopes, and it was kind of a fad, you know, secret marriage
in them days anyhow, but, uh, anyhow, they just, you know, weren't a secret marriage.
And, uh, then Elmer's dad, uh, Fisher, he had a heart attack, a stroke, and died.
And, uh, he was a nice old guy.
I said he was a guy.
He wasn't so old.
He was in his fifties.
Uh, maybe he wasn't even in the fifties.
But he seemed like an old guy.
Oh, and once you said Elmer was born when her mother was born.
Yeah, she was, she was a late, uh, uh, late being born.
And she was way behind the other, her siblings.
Hmm.
No, I don't know.
I don't know.
Anyhow, Lida.
Lida.
And her niece, uh, was there and was looking for a tablecloth in a cedar chest.
Or a chest of some kind.
Here she found a marriage certificate.
Oh, she said, you're married.
Well, then it got out.
Her dad never knew about it.
Hmm.
And, uh, well then Bill moved in with them afterwards.
And they had him move in.
And so he went there with Elmer and with Elmer and their mother.
Hmm.
When did your dad stop expecting him to give him the money?
Well, that was it then.
Yeah.
Hmm.
So then when you told him you were going to run away,
Texas, what did he get?
I told him he sent the sheriff out to me,
but I guess he probably did because I never had one catch up with me.
So then tell us about it.
Well, I, uh, the night before I was going to leave,
the night I was going to leave,
I ate an extra plate of, uh, fried potatoes.
I never cared too much about fried potatoes because that seemed like a dish of everything.
That was all that Laura knew how to cook.
It was fried potatoes.
It was creating all the time.
At least a meal a day on fried potatoes.
Raw fried potatoes.
And, uh, but I ate an extra amount of them that night.
All I could now be eat or whatever.
And, uh,
And, uh,
She was fussy about how much she ate.
And, uh,
She only cooked so much.
And that had to do.
And, uh,
I figured that might be my last meal for a while,
which it was.
And, uh,
I went to town.
It was on Saturday night.
I went to town.
See, the trains didn't come until in the evening.
Night sometimes.
Did you tell them you were leaving?
No.
No.
I just told them that one time I was going to leave.
And, uh,
And, uh,
I went to town.
And, uh,
I went to the pool hall where my Uncle Otto played Buck Bucher on Saturday night.
That's the only night he played.
And he'd play with the guys around him.
That night.
That's your mom's brother?
My dad's.
Dad's half.
Oh, okay.
He was a little lonely.
And, uh,
I, uh,
stood behind his chair watching him play.
And,
I was wishing I could talk to him.
Tell him I was leaving.
And,
but I didn't want to talk in front of the other guys.
Or even distract him from his play.
So,
I,
I just stood behind his chair a while.
And then I left.
Went back.
And I had a bag
that I was taking with me.
Which I lost later,
on the train.
Did you have it stashed somewhere?
Yeah.
And, uh,
I, uh,
probably in the house of Knoxville.
It was a secret.
And,
got the bag and went down there,
along the side of the railroad track,
by the water tower.
And,
ready for a train.
I was going to get on the first one to come.
What town is it in?
Royal Center.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And,
I,
I figured if it was going north,
I'd go to Minnesota.
If it was going south,
I'd go to Texas.
I bet that was a pretty scary feeling.
Well,
no,
it was kind of an adventurous feel.
Kind of fun.
And,
well,
the first train that stopped was going north.
So,
I got on,
and,
uh,
it was,
I found an empty box car,
and I got in it.
And,
right away,
as soon as that train,
the train started pulling up.
I had the feeling.
You did.
I bet you did.
I just,
that was the first time in my life that I felt free.
That's too bad.
And,
uh,
so I,
uh,
got up to Chicago on that train,
on the south edge of Chicago,
and,
uh,
got up to Chicago on that train,
Chicago,
and,
and,
uh,
I didn't,
didn't know where the,
oh,
I asked somebody where,
where you get your train going out north.
West.
Northwest.
They told me the proviso.
And I asked where the proviso was.
Oh,
it's way out.
Yeah.
I said,
well,
thanks.
He says,
here,
here,
streetcar's only a dime.
Here,
take this.
Give me a dime.
I took it.
Who was this guy?
Don't know.
Was he a passenger or another hobo?
No,
no,
he was just somebody else when I was on the street.
Oh.
So I got on the street car road up to the proviso.
It,
see,
we're talking about 50 miles out of the walk.
Oh,
wow,
that was nice of him.
You.
Of course,
I'm not sure just where that was that I got off that train.
It might not have been 50 miles.
You should call it 50 miles.
Yeah.
And,
I,
uh,
get up to proviso.
And,
what was that?
Was that the name of the station, or?
It's,
uh,
a yard.
Oh.
Or,
log tracks.
Oh,
okay.
And,
uh,
here I,
seen a trainman there,
and I said,
started walking up to him.
And,
I must have looked hungry.
He'd come walking toward me,
and give me a sandwich.
How long did he?
I must have looked real hungry.
This was the next evening after I had eaten.
It was the last year.
Hmm.
And,
uh,
oh,
there was a couple of kids there.
Here,
in this proviso,
I met a couple of kids.
They'd run away from a reform school,
but they didn't tell me that at first.
They said he was working on a farm.
Boys.
Boys farm.
Yeah.
Young kids?
Yeah.
One was 13,
the other one was 14.
Huh.
The Indian kid was 14,
the other one was 13.
Um,
and,
uh,
I,
uh,
I shared that sandwich with them.
Like,
with tiny performances.
Is it Ibiza.
Yeah,
yeah.
Could be a flicker.
You have to kinda do again?
I'm too,
you have a friend in the room and let me go.
Thank you.
