Yeah, I tried to amuse these girls and take them for walks and stuff and Mildred was four, I guess
Yeah, she had to be four
Joyce would have been two
Finally, it was right after the baby was born. She said, I'm going to the house. Well, I didn't argue about her
I let him go in then
and
See the new baby
Well, then it was still pretty new baby when
We quit sod and he sold the
Boy and not the boy
sold a lot of scrap iron to some Jew from
Shouldn't say that should be some Hebrew
From International Falls, but he never did get paid the guy didn't pay
And
And
Ralph and I loaded that boiler
And
And the engine the steam engine
Onto the semi
And then
Had room for the cow on there
And chickens
Made a fence for the chickens
Made a fence for the chickens
And we made a ramp to get the cow up onto the semi
And
And
We
Too many handles
And
Loaded a bunch of household stuff that they were taking
Loaded the cow up
Took off for
Oh, I didn't finish about this house on the trailer
He wanted a house built on that trailer
So I
Got
I got a floor on the trailer
And
Got that
No, first I actually
The trailer
Put
Hangers under to hold that
House up
And
They were just hanging on big bolts
But
They were sturdy and everything
And I built the trailer
Build a floor on the trailer
And
Put
Put the house down on it
Fastened it all together
I did this all on my own
I'd never done anything like that
But Ralph trusted me to do it
And
She was busy otherwise
And
We loaded
The cook stove in there
And
A bed
And
A canned blueberries
That Grace had picked
She picked blueberries right after the baby was born
And Laura
She picked and picked and picked
And she won the 100 quarts
So she finally got it
I dropped it and I picked some of them too
And she'd take Lester out in a
A
Wagon
They had
They had a wagon
A little wagon
And she had a basket in it
And she put a mosquito net over it
From
A
Rock
And
They came along to the very patch
And she'd pick that
How far away was the very patch?
Oh
Some of them were pretty close
Other times she'd go farther
And it was just within walking distance
And
Good picking?
Yeah
They were pretty good that fall
Yeah
Uh
But the frost come early and frozen
And
We've seen them afterwards
Hanging thick and frozen
On the
Vines
Well then we got Gordon to the North Carolina
And
Oh
He'd got a different car
He goes on and bought a
Car
Uh
A
35 Chevy
It only had 4,000 miles
The people who bought it didn't like it or something
For some reason or another
And
Let the company have it back
And
Wasn't nothing the matter with the car
It was just like a new car
Only they'd haul the dog in it
And they'd threw up on the seat or something
How much did he pay for it?
I don't know
What?
I met him
About $400 I think
Uh
I was going
A lot
I had taken a load of lumber to Rosso
With the truck
To sell it
And
I
Uh
I was coming back empty
And
Ralph
All at once
There'd come a car
By
By me
And it honked
And
It was him
He stopped
And
He's
He's the car I got
He had traded that other one on us
I guess he got a couple hundred or 250 for the other one
Maybe he paid five
He paid five
I don't
For the other one
And
Um
He
He says
The motor's running
Well
I didn't know it
I was used to a roaring truck
And
He says
Get in it
And take it
And when you get down there
Home
And he says
Take
Uh
Grace and the kids for a ride
And
So we did
And
I did
He drove the truck home
We got home before
He did
And
Well
We put it to hitch on the truck
I mean on the car
And hooked onto that trailer
Boy it was everything
Because this trailer was heavy
The trailer was way more than
It was tough
Just the trailer itself
And this was the new car you bought
Well it was pretty
Yeah
I drove the car
And the trailer
And Grace
And the kids rode with me
And
Grandma Holt
Rode with Ralph Denton
In the truck
And
Grandma Holt
I mean Grandma Holt
That's Grace's
Mother
And
She wanted to be the first to get there
And she figured Ralph would get there first
To North Carolina
She was there
She was there
To get to the south
She had been raised in Louisiana
Or somewhere
And she liked it
Of course Grace had been too
She was wanting to go south
And they missed the south
How did they find out?
They advertised through the church papers and stuff
I guess
But they wanted to find
It was the 70th Adventist outfit
So the school advertised for something?
Yeah
Yeah
And
So
Yeah
Down there
Therozal
Somehow or another
Ralph was ahead of me
I was following
But anyhow
He was ahead of ways
And
He
He
He
He stopped
And he said
Oh there was a detour
They were working on the roads
And
He says
I can't run the truck in high
It's just too heavy a load
And
He said
When we get to Thief River
Or Middle River
Or somewhere
We're going to have to do something
We're going to have to do something
Either get a
Lower speed rear end
Put in it
Or something
Or
Trade it off for another truck
And
Well we got down to Middle River
Middle River
And
There was
A guy there
Middle River
That he knew
And
We got to see him
And
He had
Priced a truck
Oh
There was
It was pretty high priced
It was
It looked worse shape
Than what Ralph Denton's was
But it was newer
And
He
Sold
He
He
He didn't want to get hit
And then he didn't want the truck worked on
Finally he decided
That
Maybe
He didn't need to haul that
Boiler
And that engine down
So
He
I talked to this guy
He run the tin shop in
Middle River
You'd wonder how much business there was
In a tin shop
Just
To support a plant
But
He
He had a lot
Quite a lot of business
Just in a tin shop
Making stuff out of tin
And
He
He
He said
He had an empty lot there
And he says
You could just dump it off
In that empty lot
So we took the semi
Over there
And
We unloaded the car
And
Everything
Unloaded everything
I can't remember
What
No
I guess
We didn't have to take the chickens off
We just rolled that
It seemed like we did
But I don't know what we did
To the chickens
Or
They didn't get away
When they
Unloaded
And
Uh
We
Rolled that
Boiler off
And we just
Rolled it
Put a jack under one side
And rolled her off
And the engine
The same way
This engine
This engine
Flywheel weighed over in time
Just the flywheel
We had a heavy load on that trailer
Well then we loaded the cow back up
When we was ready to go from there
We spent the night there
And
And
Uh
It must have been on a Friday
Because we spent a Sabbath sometimes
By the long
We didn't drive on time
We spent Sabbath
Anyhow
Uh
It was
Then
Then
That truck pulled it easy
When
After we got rid of that
Heavy boiler
Heavy boiler
That boiler weighed eight tons
And
Okay great
Not all
Oh
And
Uh
The
Engine
Was
Over three tons
How did you get it off?
Rolled it off
We put a jack under it
And just
Dipped it right off
The truck
How old did you use it for?
Sawmill in Florida
In North Carolina
We still had the sawmill on there
Oh
Uh
Kind of stripped down
Parts
He was going to build it back up
All the iron from the sawmill
On the sawmill
To
Oh
A lot of stuff
We had a load on there
Well
I don't think he did
He didn't
He didn't
He didn't
He didn't
He didn't
Well
We went on down
And
Uh
Toward Florida
I mean
Toward
North Carolina
But then they stopped and got Evelyn
Or had he already gone down?
No she was in
North Carolina
Oh he had already
That was the first one
This was after we'd come back up
Now what time of year was this that you were gone?
Just in the fall
Uh
We went clean down through Minnesota
Cleaned through the southern part of the state
And had never been in the southern part of the state
And had never been in the southern part of the state
Here we run into hills
I didn't know there was hills there
One little
Long hill
Boy the car got hot coming up that hill
And the truck did
Good thing you didn't have a boiler on there
But it did pull it
We'd never pulled it
With the truck
With all the other stuff on
We'd never pulled it
We'd had to unhook the trailer off the house
And
I mean off the fire on the front of the truck
To get up a hill like that
We'd come down through
Uh
Hudson
Minnesota
And I'd never been to Hudson
And they had a spiral bridge there in Hudson
And I'd never seen a spiral
That's the only spiral bridge I ever saw
Across the
Across the
Mississippi
I thought that was
It was a big cross
It wasn't the south of the Mississippi
No it wouldn't have been the Mississippi
I don't know what river it was
Well anyhow
Uh
The north side
You could have
There was a slope going up on the bridge
But on the south side
There wasn't room
Because the city was right there
Hudson was
Hudson
Hudson's on the bridge
St. Croix River
St. Croix River
That shows how dumb I am
In history
Between Wisconsin and Minnesota
We weren't going into
Wisconsin
We were still in Minnesota
This was on
In Minnesota
Hudson, Minnesota
Did you go to Wisconsin?
Not there, no
This
This spiral bridge
This spiral bridge
It had to make a spiral
To get down off the bridge
Yeah, it went around
A full circle I think
Then come back down onto a street
It probably ain't there now
That was a world famous spiral bridge
At that time they advertised it
Anyhow, we got on down
You went on that with your whole
You went on that bridge?
Yeah
On down through some of Iowa
And into
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Right in their house
Oh
Yeah
Yeah
Um
And how we slept?
All the same bed?
I don't know these floors
You go home
They're cheap food
Slept in some place
I must be around the floor
Kids and everything
It was only about eight by twelve
Anyhow
Uh
We got down into
Kentucky
Finally
And Ralph was ahead of me
And I
All at once
One of them bolts broke
That held the house up on the
On this trailer
And
You heard it?
Yeah
Well I realized it right away
Because we were dragging on the tire
You know
The wheel well was
We were dragging on the wheel well
Uh
See I made wheel wells over the wheels
Oh
And
Um
Pulled it off the road
And unhooked in a hurry
And drove
And the rest of them stayed there
Grace and the kids stayed there
And
I took off and I cut
It was on a detour
Dirt road
And
Through back country kind of like it was
It was
Stopped right by an old plantation house
And uh
Oh that was amazing
Uh
And uh
I caught up with Ralph in a couple of miles
He wasn't too far ahead of me
And I told him what was happening
What
What do we need to fix it?
He said
Well
Chain binder and chain
And I knew where they were
Where they were
In his truck
I mean
On the semi
I said
Alright
And so we
Uh
We parked the truck
And
He went back there with me
And
Uh
Took that chain binder
And I raised the
House up
With the jack
And
Put that chain binder around
And
And
I mean
The chain around
And snapped that chain binder around
And
We went the rest of the way
That way
There was no problem at all
Then
Good thing we didn't break
The other one
We
Run out of the chains
I don't know why that would have broke
A big
Three quarter inch bolt
But
Of course
I don't know
Too rough
Yes
This trailer was rough
Then
The springs was heavy on that trailer
Didn't that see the plantation house?
Uh
No, but while we had gone
Uh
They had brought a pie out
And give it
From the
Plantation
They saw
Then
People out there
And they brought a pie out
And I said
Boy, we're in Southern Hospitality
We had a piece of that pie
I guess so
That was nice
Yeah
That was nice though
And a pie was it
Raisin or something
And I said
I don't know
Sure did
I don't remember
Well, we went on
We ran into other hills
He was trying to steer clear of them hills
But he didn't understand the country or something
You know
He can't really steer clear of them all though
You can't miss them all, no
And remember one time when he was going up a hill
And it was easy enough to pull
But he was in low gear
He was in low gear
Uh
And I
I was right behind him
Quite often
I'd stay
Next
Right to him
And
Uh
There were some kids
Riding a bicycle
Going up this hill
And he told them
Grab a hold
And they did
And he towed them up the hill
I'd be illegal
Really
I'd be glad to have something
Well, we got down into Nashville, Tennessee
And
Uh
We were going through there
In any evening
And
There was traffic
And
All at once
We heard a chicken
Get out of that
Truck
Somewhere or another
Looking for a place to roost or something
I don't know how they'd get out
We had a pretty good pen maze
But
Anyhow, a chicken got out
And they were sitting right in the street
And
Uh
Ralph seen it get out
Or somebody pointed at it
Ralph says
There was a black guy
Standing there
On the side
Of the corner of the sidewalk
Where we were going to turn
And he says
She's yours
He hollered at this black guy
Did he go get it?
I don't know
Uh
He got it before
He's got to run over or not
And
He was just sitting there on the street
And not wanting to know what to do
Well, I couldn't stop
To pick her up
Even if I could have caught her
Kept going
And we camped
Just
West of Nashville
Somewhere or another
I don't know
I don't know
Whether they think
Nothing's going south there
That's where he should have taken off
And went down through
Uh
I don't know what we were doing in Nashville
Anyhow
He was going way south
He went on down into Georgia
Augusta, Georgia
West of Georgia
Before we
Took off
East
Yeah
To go to North Carolina
It
Uh
He figured he was missing the mines
Maybe
He wouldn't have pulled it over the mines
But I think he could
I don't think there'd have been that much problem
But anyhow
He went way out of his way
To get to North Carolina
And
Of course the roads wasn't super like they are now
Oh
When we was coming through Kentucky
There was a
Trucker
That
Seen
He was on the road
And he
He talked to him
And he said
You don't want to go on certain highways to Kentucky
He said
They'll catch you
He said
They
You might not have a thing wrong with you
But they'll stop you
And find you
And
Ralph took a chance on it
And
He'd hear advice
And
I
Was
I was behind him again
Somewhere or another
And I
Come up to
And
There was this truck
Sitting along side of the road
His truck?
Yeah
He wasn't there
And
Well
We parked behind it
And just waited
And pretty soon
Here comes the highway patrol
Kentucky
Maybe one highway
Maybe a city
I
Don't know
Who was
Having a toll road
There
Anyhow
Here they brought him back
And
They had taken him in the courts
And
He had to pay a fine
And
I don't know
I think it was twelve dollars
That
That
Don't sound like much nowadays
But
He
Anyhow
He had to pay us
And
Then
We went on
They didn't charge you
When they signed your deal?
No
No
No
No
They was catching trucks
Wow
We ain't out of days yet
More
More
More
Indeed
Well
Well
We finally got to North Carolina
And
I guess
It was everything that Ralph expected it to be
He lived there the rest of his life on that place
And I eventually sold the place back to him
I never had title to it anyhow
Wait
Wait
No
What was the place like?
What did it look like?
Oh
Flat ground
It just had just a little slope toward the canal
Because when the water came up about an inch high on the ground
It flowed that way
Toward the canal
Maybe it wasn't slope
Yeah
It was a swamp
It was a green swamp
But
It wasn't always that way
We got a big rain on time
Did he ever plant fig trees or anything like that?
Uh
He had a fig tree or bush or so
And
Not highly in the field
Did they grow a garden?
Uh
Some garden every year
But not too much
Huh
Uh
But then he offered to sell you five acres?
Yeah
Uh
Two hundred dollars
He
He paid eight hundred dollars for the place
Uh
He didn't have it on when he told me I'd buy it
So
Some of it
Some of it
And I paid
I paid all the two hundred off on his
But later he bought it back
He wanted to raise gladiolias on it
He was in the gladiolia business raising them and selling it
Huh
And he wanted
He said that was his best
Uh
Gladiolia ground
I had cleared about an acre
On it
And had it worked up
It was good ground
Cleared it before
Brush
I don't think
Oh
I guess I cut a few trees off it
But mostly it was kind of just brush
So then you bought the five acres from 10 point did you do that?
Oh I agreed right off the bat
You know I'd take that
It was good because he needed the money
I uh
Had a hundred and some dollars at first
And I sent him the rest of it after I'd moved back to Minnesota
No
After I was working in Washington D.C.
Well you haven't gone that far yet?
No
So then when did you marry Evelyn and start liking Evelyn?
You're going to have to get to that sooner or later?
1938
How much longer?
About a year, I guess
She was still in school?
Yeah, she was still going to school
About a year that you started liking her or about a year that you got married?
When she was married, I guess
And tell them about that
Well, one must tell
Took her down
Went to get a marriage license
And they said, uh
Oh, I asked how old we were
Evelyn went along
I went to get the marriage license on my own
I said, no
She had to have somebody swear
Or her parents' permission or something
She was only seventeen
And so Grace went with me
And we went and got the marriage license
And it was on a Friday
And uh
Stopped at the preacher's place
And it was after sundown
And she says, oh no, he wouldn't marry on Sabbath
So
Uh
Didn't get married till
Monday
Monday
I don't know
Sunday or Monday
And Ralph said we could take his car
To go somewhere for a honeymoon
So we went to Holden Beach
What is that?
Where is that?
That's uh
About twenty-some miles
Or thirty
South of
Where he lived
The south of the Green Swamp
And uh
We went down there and spent the night
Uh
And went down
In the car
In the car?
Do you have a tent?
No
We have a tent
We were poor folks
They went parking on your honeymoon night
No wonder it didn't last
Huh
Time to work
Oh no
Oh it's not time to shut off yet
Wait, now tell me more about that
So you uh
Went back and I got to work
And I went back
And worked in the sawmill again
For the dent
And she was out of school then?
He sawed for school then
He worked for the school as well as I did
What did you do for the school?
Working at the sawmill then
We were sawed
They set up this sawmill
I was gone during the time they set up that sawmill
We bought another boiler
And a moat engine
From a sawmill that was defuncted
It was quit sawing
And got timber running out
And they bought it and tore it down
And that was a return flew boiler
It was different than the one that
Out that we had in Minnesota
He had to feed it wood?
Yeah
Well we fired it on sawdust
You did?
Yeah
It would make steam on sawdust
And planer shavings
Sold the wood for firewood to people
And
But it was
There was more slabs than there was lumber
The people would bring logs in
That they were big enough
It didn't matter if they were crooked
So some of the slabs had the end of the log oil
People were so dumb about cutting logs
They figured any log would make lumber they figured
If a log is that crooked
You can't start at the end of it
You've got to start right here
And saw the lumber
Oh that's true
Then that whole line did no good
Yeah
I know one day we'd come out
I would scale the lumber when they come out
I run the edger
And the edgers
See Ralph would just saw the boards
And then if they needed the edge
They had bark on the edge
I'd run that edger
And I'd keep track of the lumber
If all would come out
To know how much we saw
Because they charged by so much foot to saw
It was custom sawing
You know people would have this log to saw
And it was around a thousand feet one day there we saw it
And we'd had school kids helping
And he said
How much was it
And I saw
How much we saw it that day
And he said
Well not bad when you
You're slabs that big
And he picked up a slab that had the whole end of the log going
Well not big
Well wait but tell me more about marrying Evelyn
Did you ask her to marry you or did she ask you?
I had to decide you were going to get married
I asked her and she said yes
Did you get her a ring?
I don't know
What would I have bought it with?
I was a pretty poor man
No, no ring
I think she got one afterwards or something
Or maybe I could do it
I don't know
I don't know
Never bought mommy a ring
She bought one
I don't believe in jewelry
I know
Earrings or anything else
I know
Well
Well
Well
Wasn't Jim born short of the year?
What would I have bought it with?
What would I have bought it with?
I was a pretty poor man
No, no ring
I think she got one afterwards or something
Or maybe I could do it
I don't know
Never bought mommy a ring
She bought one
I don't believe in jewelry
I know
Earrings or anything else
I know
Well
Well
Well
Wasn't Jim born shortly after that?
Well not shortly after that
But I mean
The next year
Yeah
He was born in 39
I'd have to look up the dates
I don't know what
But he
There was plenty of time for him to be
Oh, I know that
I wasn't asking that
I
You didn't wait that long to have kids
There wasn't many
There were many
There were kids in the Green Swamp at that time
I mean
In that settlement
There was
One born
Dan McKellen was born
And he was the first kid born in that settlement
And Jim was next
That was a pretty big deal
It was kind of a rare occasion
Yeah, people wanted to see the babies
Really?
And
I remember one time
I'd made a push cart out of two bicycle wheels
And
It had a basket in it
And had Jim in it
And he'd sleep during church
And one time
So all the women wanted to go see
The babies
And I had a dog
I called her Buck
And she was a
Porter Collie
And kids wanted to give a dog away
And they said
Want to know if I wanted a dog
A pup
And the dog had pups
And I said
Yeah
But they didn't wait for me to come and pick the pup I wanted or anything
They wanted to make sure they got rid of a pup
So they took it over there to our place and left it
And
Here I come home from work
And
She was just a little pup
But she'd come out and
She was by the steps
And barked at me when I come
And
She was a watchdog
Right from the start
Hmm
Well she got to be my dog
She adopted me
She wouldn't take up with anybody else
And I even have one
Uh
And she fed her too
And
She
She was my dog
She was a one man dog
She was a good cattle and sheep dog
I've had her for years
Anyhow she was watching Jim
In this
Uh
His cart
And
These women wanted to see him
And they started over to see him
And she wouldn't let him get near him
Yeah
She wasn't
She was not
She was not
Just out of the puppy stage
Yeah
And
She
She'd watch anything that was ours
Huh
Guard it
One day I was going up through by Denton
And
See I didn't have a bridge at our place at that time
Across the canal
So it always brought through their place
And
I
Had a jacket
And
I was
Had it laying across the bicycle
And I
Got up to Denton
And noticed the jacket wasn't there
Didn't remember the dog
Here I come back through there sometime later in the day
And she was laying there on the jacket
Guarding it for me
Wow
Huh
I
I could leave a car or a bicycle
And I didn't have to tell her to stay
She'd stay there and watch it
Huh
One time
I'd left my bicycle over to school
And I'd gone someplace where we were out in Denton
And
When they come back
The school kids told me that
Warren Thompson had
Throwed sticks at the dog
Till she
Go away from the bicycle
Just to be showing off in front of the other kids
And
She wanted to watch that bicycle
And
When I
When the kids told me that
I told Warren
You shouldn't have left that dog alone
Said when she's watching something of mine
You don't bother
And he cussed at me
This was a Christian school
He was a little kid wasn't he?
Well not too little
He was about
13 or 14
15
He was older than what he looked
He
He acted like a 7 year old
But
He was older
And
When he cussed me
I grabbed him
And
I took him under the
At the mill house
Under where the sawmill was
There was a pump there
And
I
Held him under the pump
A pitcher pump
And I pumped water on him
Until he apologized
On the top of his head
And down his neck
And
He apologized for it
And it turned me loose
Hmm
Well tell about when Jim was born
Born
Well
There was a doctor coming there
And
He was
To
Kind of
Do missionary work
Among the heathens
In North Carolina
He had quit a good paying job
In California
And he moved there
And
He
He
Was
Going to do doctrine
And
I
We
Talked to him
And
They
Come down
See Evelyn
And
So
He
Is
Our
Doctor
And
So
The day he was born
He
Was born
Well he took
Some urine tests
And things like that too
In the meantime
And
He
Come down
He brought a book along
And we were reading this book
He says
I always take a book along
And
You know
I'm going to know how long it's going to take
And
Finally he was born
How long did it take?
How long did it take?
Oh
Not unusual
I don't think
Not as long as some kids
He came
In the morning
And he was born
Sometime in the afternoon
And
He explained everything to me
About
Birthday
Oh
He's the one that told me
Yeah
Yeah
It was sure a benefit to me
Afterwards
And
So
He
He
Delivered the baby
For
$20
Him and his wife
His wife was a registered nurse
And
$20
And
Then
He was going to charge me
$2
For circumcising Jim
But later he'd give it back
I paid him
But he'd give it back
For $2
He'd give it to his brother to give him
On the wall
Because he moved away
Um
Yeah
I guess he figured I was hard enough
He needed the money
He was a good doctor
And he went off into the mountains
He was going to be just a country doctor
To help people
That's neat
Well
It was kind of neat
But his wife left him
She was used to having plenty of money to spend
Oh
She left him
Hmm
I often wondered what happened to him
Hmm
He'd be dead by now
He was older than me
He said
Well
Or at least he'd be in the high 90's by now
I suppose
Or up in the 90's
Hmm
Good father
What was his name?
Uh
Weir
Weir
Weir
Um
Erwin
Erwin
Erwin Weir
Erwin
Erwin Weir
He was a good father
When they came down there and looked over land
Their dad came with them
And uh
Their dad bought quite a big chunk of ground there
Oh not big
Twenty acres
Or something
And uh
He left Howard there to farm it
And he had
That was his boy
And uh
He got quite a little bit of land cleared
And
It was
But it never paid off
Hmm
None of that farm it never paid off
I don't think
Um
But we had good times there in the green swamp
Uh
Oh like
Socials
I had quite a bit of socials
You know
Special occasions
Potluck dinners
Go to them
But
No money
Work for
No cash
Just worked for credit
And uh
Fifteen cents an hour
I was top wages
Fifteen
You worked for who?
The school
Sutton Law
Pershing
Worked for Pershing
Worked for Pershing
Because he was
He was the school
He called himself
Professor Pershing
For doing what?
Working
Working around the farm
Oh
The school farm
They grew their own vegetables
And everything
Yeah
And uh
He charged you big price for everything
Groceries
In groceries
You go
You get
You use credit to buy them
High price
You had to beg him for stamps
If you wanted to write a letter
And uh
And clothes
Boy
You just about had to get down on your knees
If you needed a pair of overalls
Well
Shouldn't he be paying you to buy it with whatever he wanted?
No, no, no
He wouldn't do that
He just
You never see no money from him
Never
And
And
He was a greedy sort of a guy
But in some ways
He was alright
He let me have his car to go courting
Evelyn got a job in Whiteville
And he let me use his car to go courting
Courting her?
Yeah
After you were married?
No, before
Oh, oh
And uh
He didn't charge me for the car
It's a funny thing
He didn't charge me
He told me he was going to charge me
But he didn't
So
I guess in some ways
He was okay
What kind of job did everyone have?
Uh
Babysitting
I guess
Hmm
Cooking
Step 2
For
Shedding rich people
And
Finally
He just got twice
Step 2
And
I'd get the truck once in a while
Well
I'd borrow
But he charged me for the truck
To use the truck
Because that was a school truck then
There wasn't Dentons anymore
That was a school truck
Later
Oh you mean he took it away from that
And they gave it to him?
No
He traded it on that land
Oh
Uh
Warren
Uh
No
It was Julian
Julian Thompson
Later bought that truck from his school
Real cheap
$50
Cheap truck
Uh
Uh
$50
Quite a bit of money
And they
This was after
Thompsons had been up in
uh
North Carolina
Part of
In the mountains in North Carolina
And they had been working up there
And uh
Staying and working in a school
There
Kids guy desk
This was where Nancy lives
You know
Yeah
They built a little house
Right near Nancy's
Or Nancy's
Or
Um
Raising Nancy's
There
And
Uh
They come back
Down there
And then
He had some money then
And they had worked up there
And uh
Kids did
Was Don born at the same place?
No
Don was born in Minnesota
That
Afterward
So you must have been there
We went to Washington D.C.
Frank Lynn went
Earlier
He was up in Washington D.C.
And he wrote me and said that there was work up there if I'd want to come up for it
So I
Oh I had bought a motorcycle
Twenty-eight Harley
For how much?
Thirty-five dollars
And it was new?
With no battery
No, no, no
This was
How twenty-eight?
It was ten years old or so
And uh
But it's even
It was a good shape
Outside it needed a battery
And uh
I
I rode it up
I rode up to
Washington D.C. on it
It was?
And uh
Evelyn
and Jim
stayed down there
In North Carolina
And until later I said
They
Told them to come up
She'd come up on the bus
And we stayed up in Washington D.C. about a year
And uh
How did you work there?
I worked for a guy by the name of Ophel Mays
I think I found an Ophel
Why would anybody name their kids an Ophel?
But he was sure a nice guy
He was seventy-odd man
What would you get on?
Oh yeah
Carpenter
Well
Flunkers
Doing everything
Digging
Digging the trenches for
Septic tanks and
Septic tank holes
And
Build
Boarding floors
Good
Carpenter
That's
My first experience
Pretty much
Carpenter
I was like
A little bit here
And then
Before it happened
And
Uh
They were a nice family
And
And where did you live up there?
Uh
I stayed in a trailer at
Uh
Of Flynn's
At this preacher's place
The preacher that marries
He had gone to Washington D.C.
Before that
And he bought a place up there
And built a house on it
And he had a trailer
Or
That was his trailer I guess
That was his trailer
With kids
And
Uh
What kids?
With Flynn's kids
We slept in the trailer
And uh
Flynn's rented the basement
Of the house
That he
This preacher had built
So
He stayed there for a while
Not too long
Then
Flynn
Uh
Wanted to know
If I would rent a room
From him
If
He rented a house
And
I told him
Yeah
If
I'd be okay with him
I'd be glad
So
He rented a house
A big
A part of the house
Not the upstairs
Uh
He had an upstairs end
As well as the house
He just bought
Main floor of the house
Ended the main floor
Of the house
So
We moved over there
They weren't too far away
And
Uh
Stayed there
That was when he sent
And got Evelyn to come up
And she came up
On
On the bus
And
Then
Then
We spent
The winter of that
And
In the spring
We bought a car
Yeah
Yeah, I bought the car
And
Rode back down
The road
With
The
Motorcycle
And left it
And rode up
With another guy
