you had and then she came back I think you said that that you stayed in the house with
oh maybe I had yeah this is oh it's going oh oh that car I bought in Washington DC it had
been rolled over and it was just kind of looked like junk but I figured it was probably all right
and I just took a chance on it wasn't running or nothing and I bought license for bought new tires
for it new battery because everything was junk and got the thing going it was a 1933 Chevy and it turned
out to be a pretty good car outside of body bad so I took it down to North Carolina well first to we
the maiden trip of that was to Pennsylvania I thought it'd be nice to drive up across the
mountains to Bill's place and see them so we did and then Evelyn took a bus from there to go to
Minnesota Evelyn and Jim he was just a baby and so the car run good going over the mountains and
seemed to be good it didn't have a heater in it so you had to have bedding along with you to cover up
with in the car I guess that was back in the days before they put heaters in the cars as a standard
thing and then I afterwards I worked some more down in Washington DC and then we and then I went to
North Carolina to get stuff we still had stuff down there in North Carolina we wanted but it was kind of
dumb really to make a trip for what junk we had and so I went back down there while I was there Ralph
didn't mean and he didn't like me going off and leaving and he said why don't you just stay down back
here and if Evelyn wants to come back let her come back why chase up there after her but we had been living up
there everything and had some goats up there still on the place and so I drove back to Minnesota after a while
oh I had cut the car off right behind the front seat made a pickup out of it it made a good pickup I put a flatbed on
it and then I got up to Minnesota and got a dumb place from Lembrist bought it or took over the payments of it
40 acres of rocks and scrub poplar nothing nothing on it that amounted to anything at all and then I got some goat
in the deal and everything was done I sure do did some dumb stuff in my life eventually I left the
finger back to the state place and still had goats and finally ended up selling them to Jim Spina for
five dollars a piece for the old ones and a dollar a piece for the young ones just to get rid of them Jim O'Brien
and he said they wouldn't do a thing to camp oh he says even nothing come don't hurt them a bit come I
want you to come down there to the camp and take the goats along there's a thousand acres that they can range on
I took them down there and they they'd right away they'd get on his truck oh he didn't like that he's run out
there and he's driving him crazy and then he drives the truck away off from the building so that they
wouldn't couldn't you know when wouldn't bother it out there and then somebody left the door open on the
bunkhouse and the goats had gone in there and made the mess of the bed in the bunkhouse just made
yourself at home he says how much do you want for them goats and I said why says I want to buy them I said
what you're going to do it means I'm going to shoot them right then there's another dumb stunt of mine I
didn't sell them to I should have put a good price good price on them and let him buy them lame shoot
them if he wanted to but I didn't I hauled them out of there loaded them up the haul them out and sold
them to Jim Spina he was he stopped at our place that I had them goats there or where we were staying we
were staying in grandma Beebe's house at the time gosh from Carl Robertson and he he bought them and so
I we loaded them on his truck he had some machinery on the truck and he was hauled south of Rosa where they
lived tied them on there with that machinery and he took them away and he got his son-in-law saw them and
they said what do you want for one of them kids so he bought one thing he swapped a pig for one of the
pigs and for one of the goats young goats and Jim Spina says oh and then pretty soon he brought the
goat back and give back to Jim Spina pretty good throw up a goat for a pig and and get the goat back he
thought they looked cute up on top of his haystack but he didn't like he didn't put up with that very
long he got rid of the goats I don't know what he did with them but he got rid of them yes they'd spoil
that hey they like to hear the rattle of their manure when they let it go on something and you think they
do yeah I think they do yeah same with sheep mommy told me that the sheep would get on them and pile
of lumber and do do the job they like to hear it rattle on them boards and then leave their mark on
things well that was the end of my group business for at that time later we got goat skin but not right then
what else do we want to talk about oh well don was yeah we we we had bought land from Jim O'Brien 80 acres
and uh five hundred dollars south of Williams seven miles south and a mile east and uh
oh no he was born on that 40 acres I got from Lambrest yeah well well oh yeah there was a little shack on it
and uh that uh that I later sold to Jim O'Brien for a wood shack and uh we uh John Don was born there
and oh I was on get a doctor well I went and I couldn't get no doctor and I Mrs. Brist uh she come over
and she delivered Don and in our shack there how long did Jim labor not very long no she had him fast uh
he had big kids no I don't know I don't know how big he was we didn't weigh him in then days that weight
business is a bunch of foolishness and how big they are and everything that's dumb why why bother how tell how
tell how much kids weigh when they're born and how much how big they are and how much hair they got
and if they got a tooth or not that's dumb well remember anything interesting about Don's birth
no but uh morning after he was born I went out and made a cradle for uh bed for him you did yeah I made up a bed
out of little pieces of uh poplar huh wonder whatever happened to him I don't know well then uh sometime after
what year was that 1941 and it was in the fall September the 20th the 4th September the 4th
wasn't when huh yeah that's what I say the 4th Jim was born September the 21st um
so you had a lot of kids in September well we haven't been in the fall no he was in September and
Johnny was in September and he was in September and he was in September and he was in September
he was in September too oh boy that's recording September 19th and Johnny's September 10th and then he was October 1st
Johnny always said he was born in September morning well uh after I uh
uh Don was born I worked for uh Ward Davis for a while cutting timber pulpit
I worked for him for a while to get money enough to go to Florida
and then we had not Florida North Carolina I said well I told Evelyn that that'd be maybe the last chance we could go down there in North Carolina and so let's go down for the winter
so we loaded the dog and buck and the kids and another junk into the trailer into the car and we drove to Florida
I don't know North Carolina on the way an axle went out off in the country somewhere and had to get it towed to town
fortunately the price on towing and work wasn't near what it is now
uh it cost me seven dollars to get that thing towed to town and an axle put in it
I thought it was sure good it wasn't it wasn't that anymore otherwise I'd have had to stop and get a job and work it out
and cause we didn't have Montreal and you had enough to get to Florida
and we get down to Florida and we went by way of uh Washington D.C. uh Penn Dills
no that was on the way back we did I don't know why we drive out of our way to go to Washington D.C.
but we had lived there and so I wanted to go that way I guess less mountains that way too
anyhow got down to North Carolina and I got a job planting trees for the Regal Piper Company
and uh I don't remember how much we got an hour
and I worked at planting trees for a while
in our house
Bill had a house there
if you recall the house 12 by 16 is the first house I ever built
and uh
then
uh
it was good fun planting trees
planting trees for a while
most of the winter
planting trees
wading in cold water
some of the time we were planting in water
but the water wouldn't have lasted there
it wouldn't have been away
and
one of the guys
that was planting there
one of the little boys was planting in his bare feet
and
one of the other
some of the others got talking about it
and they said well I go away
go and buy bare feet all around at home
but not when I'm away from home
and he'd wade through that water breaking ice on the water
of course we were too but we had shoes on
some of them had boots
I just had shoes I didn't have boots
I don't think
I can't remember
he's not even blooming in your lawn
he's getting well cooked
I would like to get in here
um
well then
after I planted the trees most of the winter
I don't know if we've done I think
I think we've done with planting all of them
anyhow
they were building
uh down the
Wilmington
all big booming
uh
boom of buildings
they was
had started a ship
or maybe the shipyard was always there
but anyhow they started building warships
uh
mostly
uh
these smaller ships
and
I forgot what they called them
uh
victory ships or something
or whatever they called them
anyhow
there was a lot of people
flocking into William
in Wilmington to work there
and they needed houses
and
well I heard that they were building houses
and hiring
and I went down there
and got hired
and
not at shipyard
but working on the houses
building
and
and
the
sublet
the floors
and the roofs
and
a lot of it
uh
the
siding
so
I started out
making floors
and
that was
ten dollars a floor
or eight dollars a floor
another guy and I
what was his name
uh
uh
Walter Freeman's
wife's
folks
they got his name
anyhow he and I got to working together
and we'd do a floor a day
we'd do a floor a day
and then
uh
in between floors
we'd
we'd do a siding
and I think we got
ten dollars a side
a house for
to do a siding
it was
something like
uh
some kind of
gypsum board of some kind
some kind of
gypsum board of some kind
or another
we'd put on the siding
that was just cheating
they put siding on after that
anyhow
we put on
some of them
and
then
then they
needed somebody
to do the roofs
put shingles on
so we started shingling
and I had never shingled in my life
I had put some wood shingles on sometime or another
on a house
but I'd never shingled
with these asphalt shingles
and
we
we started shingling
and I said
can you do that
I asked
this guy
and he said
oh yes
anybody can do that
and we started
putting
shingles on
we had to
carry them shingles
up onto the roof
sometimes
we'd get a black guy there
to put
to wheel them
on a wheel bar
to us
they'd all be dumped off
at the same place
quite a ways
from any of the houses
and
but
we managed
to do a house a day
there were 14 squares
and
the steeper roofs
we'd just put shingles on
right on the bare board
sheet
up there
plywood
and
if
if
no
no
no felt at all
under them
but if they were pretty low
we'd had to put felt on them
and
some of them would have
part of a roof
that would be
quite flat
and we'd had to put felt on them
so we could do a house a day
and
then
we stayed working at that
that was $14
for a house
and we
him and I
we'd stay right there in the house
during the week
and
uh
in one of the houses
that we were
that was being built
and
uh
they were glad to have us stay there
because
nobody stole anything
you know
when we'd be living in a house
we'd
we'd be around there
where nobody else would be around
and they were glad to have us stay in a house
we'd stay for
in one a while
and then when they'd start finishing it up inside
we'd move out into another one
and
put into a shell
oh
we'd cook up something to eat
and
I
don't remember how they cooked
whether they cooked out in the yard
or
whether they had a stove of some kind
I don't remember now
anyhow
we'd
we'd work at that
and
one day
he was
Graham was his name
real nice guy
uh
that I worked with
and he
we
he was standing on a scaffold
to
we
we were just starting off a new roof
and he
he got out on this
scaffold
and he said
I wonder if this is safe
and he jumped up and down on it
and they broke down
and
he fell down
and
he had another scaffold down underneath it
or part of that same support
and he laid down there on the ground
and I went down and got down off the roof
and carried him in and laid him down on my bed
and
and
he
he was conscious
but he
he couldn't walk
and
he'd hurt his back
and
so I
I let him sleep on my bed
and I slept on his on the floor
he's always slept on the floor on pallet
then the next day
then the next day
that
yeah
that
the next day
because that was in the evening
that we were just starting another roof
I
went out to
I
wanted to keep working
I went out to Flynn's place
and
hired
Francis Flynn to come help me on the roof
that was kind of a dumb venture
and I was always doing dumb things
because he couldn't walk on a roof
he was scared to get up on a roof
and I had to carry all the shingles
but he had trouble finishing that roof up
well that was all for Francis
I
I let him go
I
figured I'd be better to be doing it myself
anyhow
if I had to carry all the shingles
and he was slow on the roof
he didn't share the money
he didn't share the work
and
I
I paid him off
and then the next day
Graham come back
and said he'd be able to work
if I'd carry all the shingles
and so I did
and he
he'd come up and worked
and
and we
we went on
working
I
forgot to tell you
when we first started working
on the first house
somebody come along there
and
looked up there
and he says
do you fellas know what you're doing
and we assured him that we did
and he went on
it was pretty soon
the boss come along
and he looked at us
and he looked at that roof
and he just shook his head
and walked on
he didn't say anything
but we got better as time went on
by the time we were done
we put on a pretty good roof
I hope none of them leaked
they looked terrible
as I look back on it
and to see how we had done it
oh
I learned a lot since then
here the boys tell
used to tell people that they learned from me
oh
they did a better job on their roofing business
than I ever could have taught them
well
worked till spring
and I saved the money
as much as I could of it
to get back to Minnesota in the spring
why
and
well
had goats up there
in the place
and such as it was
it was something to go back to
oh boy
what state was Don born in?
yeah, born in Minnesota
oh
so you owned
yeah, this was south of town
this was six miles south
and a quarter of a mile east
I know, but you went down to here
just
during one year after that
no, that was
uh
was this before Carol was born?
oh yeah
the spring moved in 1940
see, we went back up there
in 1941
and I bought that place from Jim O'Brien
and
um
and I got calls from the army
and they wanted me in the army
and
uh
we were
see, I bought this place from Jim O'Brien
and
they had a little log house on us
which place?
in Minnesota
the one south of Carolville?
yeah
east of
Carolville
yeah
and
uh
west?
I mean west of
Carolville
I'll get it straight
after a while
you think Carol was born in the next spring?
no, no, no, no
we had lived there
and
I worked for Jim O'Brien
and
uh
finally
uh
bought this place from Jim O'Brien
and
it's eighty acres
for five hundred dollars
and you should have had on that
yeah I should have
it was
it was
it was kind of a nice place
it's
demand now
and
uh
I
uh
we lived in that little old log house
and then
Mrs. Bancroft
the police people
people that owned the place
they were old timers there in that house
in that
on that place
no
they didn't own that house
no
no
no
no
no
no
no
no
they owned the place near the log house
it was a log house
and old Bancroft had died
and his wife had moved
uh
or maybe they both had moved
but anyhow he had died
she lived in International Falls
and
she
she
stayed at our place
and
uh
I
was gone someplace
when she moved into our place
and
uh
stayed
and then
I come back and here
Mrs. Bancroft was living there
I don't know where I had gone
anyhow
uh
she said that
oh
I want you to live in
my house
so you just move over there
into my house
and spend the winter
and said
it won't cost you a thing
you just live in it
well
was it a nice house?
it was a
did you ever see it?
it's a
part of it's still there
it's
it ain't falling down yet
the log house?
yeah
I thought you lived in that log house
so
that place
getting all mixed up
well
we had lived in that little house
at our place
yeah
it was a little house
well
it was
it was almost
to Bancroft's land
so the log house up there
wasn't the first one you lived in
no
the first one I lived in
on our place
was on our place
yeah
after I bought the place
oh
it was an old house
it was built in 1910
and
and
it was a little log house
just a single room log house
yeah
the hearse was bigger than that?
oh yeah
it had two rooms down
and upstairs in it
oh
and
and
uh
try to get off the track
so she insisted
we move over into her house
so I went over there
and took the boards off the windows
there was boards over the cupboard over the windows
keeping from getting broke out
and
we moved in
and
ooh
it was a cold house
and
we
you didn't have a stove?
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
but it took a lot of heat
I had a barrel heater
I
I usually had a barrel heater
and I said
how much do you want for that barrel heater
and he says
three dollars
so I bought the barrel heater from him
and
so
I had a little heater before that
but it wasn't big enough
it was just smaller than
about that size I guess
it wasn't big enough to hold
very much fire or anything
so I
got that
oh
I didn't
yeah
after you moved in
I thought maybe I worked for that stove
because I did work for Osley some
I believe I worked a day for that stove
and I had it set up
and it would heat up the house pretty good
and then in cold time
I'd get out there and I'd carry water
because we had to get to water from our own well over on the other place
but Pancroft never had a well
they got some water from a spring some place
along the creek
they lived on a creek and there was a spring there
that's still going
and
I'd carry water over there and I'd throw it at the house
well by the time it got to the house
it would freeze right on the house
and
what is that
to freeze the cracks shut
see
it had
plastered with cement stuff on the
on the plaster
but it shrunk away from the walls
so that it was cold
the wind could blow through
and you throw water on
but I didn't want to tear the plaster off
and do the job of plastering again
it was a big
good
pretty big house
so I'd throw water on
and let it freeze and
crack shut
you'd have to do it every once in a while
I'd do it several different times during the winter
and
it was a werewolf carrying the water over there from our well
and doing that
to make that house warmer
one night
and it did make a difference
oh yeah
it would make it warmer
because it would stop the wind from coming through
and stop the heat from going out
to some extent
and
one night
Thompsons come down there
and we was going to play high five
as the card game
they called harsh high five
I learned it from them
I'd never heard of anybody else playing it
and they'd come down there
and we'd play
we played cards
all one night
all night long
all night long
and it was the coldest night in the winter I believe
so it was alright
because I stayed up and fired
kept everything from freezing up
and
they
before they had come down
Evelyn had made
apple pies
and
and I had churned up ice cream
because we milked a cow
and we had plenty of milk
and
um
I had made two freezers full
I made one
and
cranked it out
and then put it into something else
and set it outside where it was cold
and then cranked up another one
and
that it
and
uh
Thompsons come down there
and we played cards all night
we ate ice cream
and
apple pie
all night long
well
not all night long
but we ate
them two freezers up
that was two quart freezers
we ate a gallon of ice cream
and a couple of pies
did they have kids?
during the night
yeah but they went to sleep as soon as they come
they were little
they just put all the kids in here?
yeah
put them all in the bed
went alone
and went to sleep
Carol wasn't born yet
was she?
no
she was born in the spring
after that
hm
she was born
January 12th
till 10th of the day
January the 12th
yeah this is her birthday
yeah but
was Evelyn pregnant then?
yeah
well it's actually spring
they weren't
she wasn't born
they weren't
she wasn't born then
that wasn't that spring
it was
it was
after that
that she was born
uh
Evelyn decided
at the time
to have the baby
was on
and it was a cold
night
and
uh
she said
get a doctor
she said
and
she didn't trust me
around the place
I guess
and
uh
I went
with the car
and called a doctor
from Roseville
and
uh
he was a
dumb old doctor
and
uh
I
when I
got back to
the
from calling the doctor
oh this was in the afternoon?
got back in the car
no no this was in the middle of the night
oh
and uh
get back from calling the doctor
I heard her hollering in the house
and
I
uh
I
pulled the plugs out of the car
and let the water drain out
because I run it with water
I had put hot water in to start it
and
and
I
I
water in where?
the radiator?
yeah
yeah
the radiator in the block
I pulled the plug and I drained them
and drained it
and
uh
and went and run in the house
and
it's time for her to be born
so she was born
and
well then
she was hollering in the house?
yeah
well
and you delivered Carol then?
yeah
and then
in the morning
everything went okay?
yeah
well then
the doctor got there in the morning
and
he
he come in the house
and
he says
boy this is a cold house
and
he warmed his hands
and
he glanced at the baby
and
and Evelyn
didn't do nothing
nothing at all
nothing at all
and
uh
kept telling me
it was a cold house
and I said
well how much do you want?
and he says
forty dollars
well I paid him
what is the matter with you?
I wouldn't have paid him
the baby was born
wasn't it?
dumb
yeah
this was in the morning
afterwards
we got there about
nine o'clock in the morning
or something
it was daylight
and Carol was born during the night?
yeah
and
what time of night?
I don't know
around one o'clock
I guess
huh
and
uh
he warmed his hands
and left
and you paid him?
yeah I paid him
that was dumb
I don't know why I paid him
why I even asked
just some more dumb things on my part
and I recorded the birth he didn't bother doing that
I was the nearest doctor
they didn't have any midwives in the town or anything?
or maybe it was a war road
maybe war road
I don't know
anyhow
why
why have I called a doctor
there's more than I know
did I give you yourself?
hey
it was that winter
no
no
no
it was winter before
what was?
I went
we went to North Carolina
I don't know
we didn't go to North Carolina anymore after that
well
Anita
I mean
Carol was
three months old I guess
and
uh
when the army finally caught up with me
and called me
and I got several calls
got a call from North Carolina
to
to go to the army
well I just went down to the draft board
and
told them I was moved
so then they
called me
from there
later
I don't know how much later
from what?
from Bedette
called me to go in the army
well
I went down
they had a
had a bus
taking us to
Minneapolis
did you tell the kids
Jim
how old was Jim
in the afternoon?
three?
four?
years then
four
what do you think
was the reason?
years two
yeah
two hundred
John and Donna was born
and two hundred
two more
Carol
well
I didn't know
just going
did you know how long
you were going to be gone for?
no
uh
well first I just went for the physical first
then got the call later to go to the army
well
got down in the army
well tell about that
about leaving
and they
they
when they found out
how old I was
how old were you?
twenty seven
um
where was it then?
Fort Snelling
Minnesota
what's the hell about getting there?
you just drove there?
no they took us down on a bus
they had a
chartered a bus
to take us down there
yeah from Bidette
no
picking up
picking up at Wiggins
did?
yeah the bus picked me up at Wiggins
didn't have to go to Bidette
then
but
uh
got down
I thought people with families didn't have to go
um
yeah
three kids
they didn't
why did you look at them?
when they
I get down to Fort Snelling
they said
we don't know what you're doing here
they said
you must have had a
friend
on the draft board
somebody that wanted you to be there
somebody that railroaded me
well
it might have been
might have been
might have been
Jim O'Brien influenced the draft board
could have?
yeah
was Evelyn visiting the cook camp at that time?
or
did she know him then?
uh
yeah
we had
stayed
at one of his camps
and I had charge of the camp
uh
that was when
it was on the
canadious place
and uh
she cooked
for the crew
and
and I
I'd look after the crew
when Jim O'Brien wasn't there
when he was there
he'd do it
but
a lot of the time he wouldn't be
there at the camp at all
he didn't stay there all the time
so I'd
check out
and I'd
put people on
strips
uh
to
mark them off
or where they was going to go
and
and then
uh
and check up their timber
when they was going to leave
or
unpaid
but Jim O'Brien would pay them
and
uh
I didn't get paid anything for this
all I got paid was what I cut myself
so you
and uh
you think he might have influenced them
were you the only one that old with the family?
well
no
I met an Indian that had five kids
he must have had a friend on the draft board
unless he volunteered
maybe his wife volunteered him
so you didn't volunteer
but he didn't stay in the army very long
no
um
he
uh
he got discharged
he was older than me too
ah
he must
his wife must have volunteered
volunteered him to the army
ha ha
ha
I don't know what happened
how would he have
how would he get there in the army?
no
no
no
that was in support he had
I don't know
anyhow I loaned him money afterwards
and never did get it
while he was in the army
um
but um
after the physical
we could go home again
but
until we'd be called
there were sure a bunch of people
four effers
that was turned down
single guys
that was turned down
it made me feel good
about being able to
go in the army
you know
to be
physically
uh
called anyhow
well once you got to Fort Snelling
what was it like?
oh
see
it was later
we
was sent down
to the army
you know
after we'd gone home
well then
that time
I had to go to Bedette
to begin
to
get the bus
I don't know why
had to meet all in Bedette
well they paid a hotel room
to Rex Hotel
for us
so that we'd be all there
early in the morning
early in the morning
to take us off
to the army
and
before we got down there
in the army
uh
just
sat around for a while
wanted nothing to do
or anything
and
they'd give us clothes
and
no they didn't give us
we went on down
they shipped us to
after several days
they shipped us on a train
to
Texas
a bunch of us
to
Camp Barkley
Texas
and
that was a
camp they built out
nowhere really
uh
out from
Abilene
Texas
and
don't get confused
with Abilene
Kansas
I believe in Texas
it was on old cow town
still was pretty much then
and
uh
I've seen
uh
later
after that even
horses tied up to
a
meter
in town
but
no hitching rails
and
uh
got down there
at uh
at
Camp Barkley
on his train
and train ride
and
I don't know how many days
it took to get there
it was kind of slow
and
uh
uh
troop train
I bought a bunch of candy bars
you could buy them at the PX
for
three cents a piece
and
uh
uh
bought a bunch of candy bars
to eat on the train
yeah
I had them all lined up on a window
still in the train
and
uh
people come along there
and wanted to buy candy bars from me
so I started counting on the candy bars
for ten cents a piece
and
sold them all
I didn't eat any of them
I don't think
and sold for a dollar
and eat
so I couldn't
uh
I don't know how much they should give for them
but I sold them for ten cents a piece
well then
they stopped in
stopped some place or another
Dallas
I guess the train stopped
or somewhere or another
and I thought
the candy bars was going pretty good
so I
got off the train
and the guy said
where are you going
the guy that was in charge of the coach
the army guy
so I'm going to get some candy bars
so he let me go
and I went and bought a box of them
and
and
I sold all of them
a whole box for ten cents a piece
and
um
and
I
played a lot of blackjack on the train
going down there
I wonder where you learned to play blackjack
Texas
uh
boys wanted to play blackjack
and
so I had a deck of cards
and
and
I got a table
and
they were a premium
and I had the only table that was in the car
and
well
I just found it in the car to start with
you know
it was a thing that you propped between the seats
and you flopped the seats the other way so that there were two seats facing each other
across this table
they had them
were there seats in the car or did you just sit around on the floor?
no, no, no, no
on the cushions
yeah
this was regular coaches
oh
and
um
you know
they could flop the seats either way they wanted to
oh
and
uh
played
played
a lot of blackjack
and
uh
mostly with the same guys all the time
but others
other people would come along and they'd get
okay
in
words
or
emplate
or
r
at
and
or
the
people
have
a
point
You
