Everywhere around there, the wind would blow a lot, and when it got dry, boy, that stuff
blowed in all over everything. It was embarrassed. It wasn't tight at all, and it could blow right
in, and boy, it'd just blow that dust all over. When it was wet, when it rained, it'd track
in. It'd be sticking on your shoes, and oh, your shoes are so dirty. Black, I mean red from
it. Huh. Wasn't any hardship, really. Annoying. Well, why don't we talk about, I don't know,
just thinking. What? I don't know. You mean it's running? Yeah, it is. You mean it's running?
Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. Well, the details are good, Dad.
Oh, that was later. They took us on a real rough hike one time. We walked about 40 miles
in a half a day. Fast. And, uh, I thought, boy, uh, we'd, everybody was wore out. That same
night, they took us out for a night hike for about 20 miles. And, uh, everybody after that
was leg-weary. And, but it'd come a bit rain and rain for two or three days, and they didn't
have us do exercises or hiking, and we got rested up. From then on, I decided that was a bunch
of foolishness, trying to break people down. These officers would bet with one another who
could make the fastest hike. And, uh, they, of course, the officers was there with us, too.
But they'd do anything to win, and at the men's expense. I bet there were some that couldn't
even hardly make it. They told anybody that dropped out of them heights, boy, they were
going again. They'd be on KP or guard duty all the time. Then, uh,
Did anybody? Oh, there was always some dropped out of anybody, yeah. Some couldn't just
couldn't do it. Yeah. And, uh, I, from then on, I didn't, I didn't try to stay with them
or anything. If they were stuck out on a hike, I didn't care whether I made it or not. I just
stopped right away, almost right away. And we got a different company commander. He was
an older fella, and, uh, he couldn't keep up with his past marches. And, um...
And you had to march all in order and everything?
So, I'd drop out. There's people sitting small back behind, and this officer walked
behind. He says, that's right, boys. Just stay here with me.
He was a good guy.
What was, um... Did I tell about when I'd jump off in the tree and let them go by?
Yeah. What other types of...
There was a boy, Jim Bowers. He kind of liked me, and he and I would march together. Well,
we started out pretty much together anyhow, and kind of the B was the B's, you know, the
edits in alphabetical order. And, uh...
He'd talk like Donald Duck. And we'd be hiking along, and he'd start talking to me. He was behind me.
Uh, where he'd be walking. And he'd start talking to me like a Donald Duck.
On purpose? Is that the way he talked about? Yeah, to tell me something.
Is that the way he always talked, or would he be told? No, no, no. He'd just be doing that.
And, you know, the corporal that was leading us, he couldn't tell who was doing it. And he didn't know where he was coming from.
And so, this Jim Bowers, he'd do that right along. He'd be...
He'd be...
He'd be...
Just full of the talking.
He'd say, hey, John. And then he'd start talking. But other people didn't even know what he was saying.
But it sounded like Donald Duck, you know. Have you ever heard this quacking Donald Duck?
Well, that's the way he'd... He'd bought God. He was an interesting caller.
Right.
He's the one I used to share, give my water to. But I didn't drink, and he'd, uh...
He'd... He'd... He was always glad to drink my canteen.
Was he young?
Besides his own. Yeah, he was younger than me.
Hmm.
He, uh... He went home...
When we got, uh, furlough...
Uh, he went home and got married.
Hmm.
To his girlfriend at home. There he is.
He called her.
And, um...
You know, after the war, I wrote to him, and he talked about his wife, and there wasn't that name at all.
He didn't have a divorce. He'd married to none of them.
Maybe when he came home, she was taken off.
I suppose. Something, because after the war, she...
She...
He didn't have Marianne.
Did...
Did he end up going to his home site?
Um...
No.
Uh...
I don't know where he got going to or anything.
It was after that I didn't see him no more.
Did you ever look him up?
I had no idea where he was.
I wrote to his home address, and he answered me back, and that was the only letter I ever got from him.
What state was he?
Pennsylvania.
Steelton, Pennsylvania.
He worked for some steel company in Pennsylvania, at Steelton, and he drove a locomotive.
Oh.
And...
No, I never... I lost touch with him altogether then.
He was a nice guy.
Oh.
Now, how long were you in Texas down there?
Oh, three months of basic training.
That was in the spring till fall.
And then, uh...
When we finished basic training, they sent some of us to El Paso, Texas.
I don't know how you stopped this thing.
Hello?
Yeah, after we finished basic training, they gave us a furlough.
And, uh...
We went home.
And...
While I went home, I...
Yeah, I sent him a knife.
A pocket knife.
And, uh...
He was just...
Still a little far.
Where did you get it?
From the...
One...
He sent him my...
He found...
I found it.
And, uh...
It didn't amount to too much with that food.
He'd enjoy that.
He always liked that knife.
From when he was a crawling baby, he'd carry around a paring knife in the house before he could walk.
And Mrs. Flynn would take it away from him.
We rented a living space from Flynn in Washington, D.C.
And, uh...
Uh...
Uh...
That was the condition that...
Uh...
Flynn rented that house.
Because, uh...
By getting other people to pay some too to stay there.
And, uh...
He'd carry that paring knife around.
And Mrs. Flynn would see him with it and take it away from him.
And pretty soon he'd find it again.
When he was little.
When he couldn't walk.
What'd you do with it?
He'd carry it around.
Carry it around.
Well, anyhow, I sent him that knife, and he lost it.
And he had told his mother that, uh, when Daddy comes home, he'll find my knife for me.
And, uh...
When I got home, it was at night.
And he was telling me, you're gonna find my knife.
Well, I said, we can't look at night.
We'll wait till tomorrow.
Well, he was satisfied with that.
Next morning we went out.
He told me where...
He showed me where he lost it to have found it.
Boy, was he proud.
Yeah, he went in the house and told his mother, he says,
I told you Daddy would find my knife for me.
It made me feel good that he had so much faith in me,
but there was too much faith I might not have been able to find.
How old was he?
Uh, something more...
He wasn't five yet.
Um...
I bet he was happy to see you when he got home.
Well, they were all...
It was all but an ear.
She was scared of me.
Carol?
I mean, Carol.
She was?
Yeah, she...
It took me a little while before I could even hold her.
She was like a little wild Indian.
She looked like a papoose, too.
She did?
And, uh...
But it was only a day or something, and I was made up to her.
How old was she when you got home?
Uh...
She...
No.
The...
I had gone...
She was born in January.
And I went to the Army in March.
And then, uh...
April, May, June...
So you came home in the fall?
January, February, March, April, May, June.
She'd have been six months old.
About.
When you came home?
The first furlough.
Oh.
Then, uh...
Eventually, when I got out of the Army and I come back...
She was walking around then and everything.
Wait, I went home again in, uh...
In Boston?
Yeah.
I actually wanted to enter.
They give us a final pass.
Just before we...
At the staging area, Camp Ellis, Illinois.
Um...
And, uh...
They give us what they call a three-day pass.
But it was on the weekend, so we had five days.
They took us in the Army.
I mean, in another room.
And...
And read the article of war about going AWOL.
Absence without leave.
And, uh...
They read that ordinance to us.
And...
And he says, any questions?
And I says, yeah.
He said, you give us a three-day pass to go home.
And then you read this article of war to us.
Uh...
He says, where do you live?
I said, northern Minnesota.
He said, you won't be able to go.
And...
I, uh...
There was nothing more said about it.
They give me the pass, and I...
You know, another boy and I got started hitchhacking.
I started hitchhacking.
Straight down, do you think they had to take about that moment?
Well, it was five days, yeah.
It was all travel time.
And, uh...
We started hitchhiking, and we hitchhiked till dark.
And, uh...
Then we figured, well, it wouldn't be so good to hitchhike beyond that.
And we wanted to make time, you know.
We didn't have too much time.
He was going to...
Tri-Cities.
Uh...
Uh...
Bettendorf.
Where's...
Iowa.
Iowa.
He was going there, somewhere near there he lived.
Uh...
He didn't go to Bettendorf.
I never heard the name Bettendorf.
They used to call them Tri-Cities.
And now it's Quad-Cities.
Bettendorf is built up since then it was Tri-Cities.
But now it's Quad-Cities.
Because there's four cities there, all bunched together.
Uh...
He was going there, and...
Uh...
We...
We got hitchhiked up to...
No, we didn't get that far.
And we...
Got on a train.
Her bus.
We were on the train.
I guess we got...
Got on a train the rest of the way.
Up to where he went.
And then...
I went on up to...
Warroad.
And from...
I don't know how I'd get on down anytime.
I went to Warroad that time.
Can't remember how I got home from Warroad.
Anyhow...
Anyhow...
I don't know.
In that time...
Roof was...
Bad on the house, and I re-roofed the house.
You must stay home.
I stayed home six days.
I got shingles, and...
It's funny, I could...
You could buy shingles still.
Everything wasn't rationed.
Really.
I bought shingles and put them on that house.
While I was home that time.
Yeah, and the kids needed that time.
Everything wasn't rationed, really.
I bought shingles and put them on that house
while I was home that time.
Yeah, and the kids needed that time.
Yeah.
I mean, oh, Carol, she wasn't scared of me that time.
But she was scared of me when I came back from the Army.
Yeah, that was another year.
I think she followed you all over the place.
And, uh, but, no, and I went back to war to get on the train.
I had my Army overcoat.
I believe I put that on one before.
No, that was not her.
If it didn't have a blanket, I'd give her the overcoat.
Yeah.
Because I didn't need it anyhow.
If I knew, I'd get another one.
For the kids to cover, I think.
Yeah.
Uh, it was cold.
It was in, uh, January, I guess.
It was after Christmas.
And we got up in the, uh, we got back to the camp, and, boy, I thought they'd be mad and
everything, you know, about me staying home too long.
And an MP had come through on the train.
They had an MP riding on the trains.
Yeah.
Military, police.
And he'd come through to check my papers.
Well, he sees that I was long overdue, or not long overdue, but I was overdue, and he wrote
on it when he had apprehended me.
And I was on my way back to camp, and, you know, if I'd been going the other way, boy, it would
have been bad.
But, I was going back to camp.
Well, I got back to camp, and, boy, they rushed me through.
Everybody else was ready to go overseas, you know, and have shots, and, uh, had, uh, all
my clothes to get changed, and everything, you know, they give us all new clothes when
we went overseas, everything.
And, I, so they were rushing me through that by myself.
I was going from place to place, getting all ready.
Then, finally, they shipped us out.
We was on a train, and we went to a troop train.
Did you get in trouble?
Not there.
And, uh, we was on this troop train, and we went up to Massachusetts.
Not, not too far from Boston, Massachusetts.
In the woods, they'd build a camp in the woods, evergreen woods.
And, anyways, we started getting ready to go overseas, you know, they was finishing up
paperwork and stuff like that on us.
There wasn't too much else, you know, to do.
And we were just waiting for the boat.
And, uh, snowed well, he was there.
And they had us do some more things, too.
Go through a gas chamber where you were supposed to be turning, uh,
tear gas.
And you did that?
While you were in there, and you were supposed to go on out with,
even though it was gas-filled.
See how frantic you might get.
What was that like?
It was bad.
It burned, burning.
You had to keep your eyes pretty well shut.
It burned your eyes real bad.
And, uh,
then, uh,
one day, here come a
guy, uh,
in the barracks.
And he was a runner from the office.
And, uh,
he thought he was really important.
And he says,
John Blunner.
And I said,
he went,
he went off that way.
And, uh,
see,
he didn't know me,
so.
And he began to pop out his chest
and cussed and says,
that so-and-so
better stay around here.
And I took him by the shirt
and shook him.
And I says,
that's me you're talking to.
Oh boy,
he got meeked right away.
And,
and said,
they want you down at the office.
Well,
I went down there,
and,
uh,
uh,
lieutenant colonel.
Uh,
he,
I hadn't announced myself
when I went in there
because they didn't know
anything either.
Nobody knows it,
hardly anybody else.
And,
he,
he started talking to me,
and there was so much noise
going on,
and everybody talking,
you know,
each one had a desk,
and they was all talking in there.
And,
uh,
he says,
let's go outside.
I think he wanted privacy
more than,
more than because of the noise.
And we went outside,
and we're standing in the snow,
and there was quite a little bit of snow there.
And,
and he says,
well,
what about it?
I said,
well,
they give us this
three-day pass
to go home.
And,
I figured it was the last chance
I'd get to go home,
so I just stayed home.
Yeah.
I stayed home six days.
Did you tell him you
ripped your house
while I made it?
Uh,
no,
I don't think I told him
I put a roof on the house.
My death,
I've forgotten.
Huh?
Did you tell him how long it took?
Well,
he'd know how long it took
if I told him
we went to North,
North of Minnesota.
And,
he says,
I don't blame you a bit.
He was a doctor.
See,
doctors was officers right away.
Oh.
And,
they got the rank right away,
and,
um,
he,
he wasn't a hard-boiled army officer.
Well,
yeah,
I,
I thought,
he said,
he said,
we're going to have to have a fine.
Oh,
don't fine me,
I told him.
He says,
I have hard enough trouble
on this situation.
So,
he dropped the fine business.
Well,
it looked like I got off scot-free.
But,
one time in France,
we were traveling,
and,
there was a sergeant,
and,
and some more of us,
guys,
was moved.
We were going to another place,
and the sergeant was in charge of us,
and he had our traveling orders with him.
And,
when they,
when they sent somebody,
I don't think they had duplicate,
of them papers.
They just give them our papers,
and,
and they'd go.
Because,
we had these papers,
and,
and I says,
that's the sergeant.
I said,
I knew him,
and,
pretty well.
I said,
let me see my papers,
and he gave them to me.
You know,
I wasn't supposed to be able to see them either.
And,
so,
I went through my papers,
and I found out,
that,
in the court-martial,
they'd give me 30 days hard labor.
Just to make it look good.
It didn't look good for him,
court-martialing me,
and all,
and giving me,
don't give me any penalty.
Well,
I never had to serve no time.
So,
you didn't have to do your hard labor?
Anytime.
I never,
I wasn't even restricted,
to the barracks or anything.
See,
I was just free to do like I wanted.
Were you headed when you got to see a paper?
Uh,
this was after we were in France.
Where were you going off?
We were going from one place to another.
And,
he was on the train.
Oh.
Uh,
when they put us on that train,
well,
they took us to a truck to the railroad station.
This was,
yeah,
we were from around Reims at that time.
Reims is a big city.
It was in Reims that the cathedral is,
Joan of Arc had crowned the king.
And,
uh,
she,
supposed to have rode her a horse,
into that cathedral.
This is,
no,
go ahead.
kind of a fun stuff business.
no,
no,
no.
This cathedral is,
takes about a block.
It's big.
She rode her horse into there,
to the front of the church,
and crowned the king.
And,
back the horse,
all the way out,
supposed to have,
Thomas.
Huh.
You can see it?
Did I see the theater?
Oh,
yeah,
I was in it.
Huh.
Uh,
you can see that theater from all over town.
It was so big.
You know,
from where we had the camp up on the hill from us,
you can look down there and go see that cathedral.
It was so big.
Well,
anyhow,
we were on that train,
and we,
you know,
this outfit we were in,
they,
they were starved out of outfit.
They didn't give us enough to eat.
They had rations there,
K rations,
in the basement of that building,
just hoarding them up,
and wouldn't give us any to take along on that train ride
when we was going to be leaving there.
Didn't give us a thing,
and it was,
three day trip.
Did you have any food to eat the whole night?
They didn't supply us any.
How did they take you?
They didn't care.
They were just getting rid of us.
We were kind of undesirable.
Just,
actually,
we were extra men.
And they picked out the ones
that they didn't want anyhow.
Main trouble with me is that
they didn't like me not salute them.
You didn't salute them?
I figured if they were a colonel or above,
I'd salute them.
Did you get an extra total of souls or not?
Always bawled me out about it.
Who wanted to salute them?
Our officers.
Well,
the one didn't care.
The other one,
boy,
he was just a lieutenant,
and boy,
he wanted to be saluted.
And he'd bawl you out?
Yeah,
well,
I told him that
in a war zone,
we didn't have to salute an officer.
He said,
you'll salute me.
Well,
after that,
I said,
yeah,
okay,
I'll salute you.
And so,
I'd give him a sloppy salute
when I'd see him.
They stopped that
on account of it
pointed out the officers.
And the officers
was the ones
that were going to get shot.
You know,
they liked to shoot the officers,
the enemy.
And of course,
we didn't have any enemy
right around us
at that time,
but they were ruling
that you didn't have
to salute the officers.
Yeah.
And,
but it wasn't a hard,
fast rule,
evidently.
Well,
anyhow,
we got on the train,
and
here I found an officer,
he was just a lieutenant,
too,
and he had some men with him,
about four guys with him,
and he,
uh,
he had a whole box
of,
uh,
sea rations,
and,
uh,
they were,
the sea rations is
different stuff in cans.
The K ration is all dry food,
uh,
like a cracker box.
And,
uh,
this,
uh,
officer,
he said,
boy,
how do you rate?
He said,
when they had sent us
to go to another place,
they didn't give us the same deed.
He said,
help yourself.
out of their box.
So I,
ate out of their box.
But the other guys I was with,
these other four guys,
didn't get anything.
We ate at a traveling mess,
and mess where,
you know,
you could,
trench mess,
you know,
where you could stop and eat.
We ate there,
maybe twice,
at one of them.
But otherwise,
on the train,
there was no food.
And so,
uh,
Moa,
I sure appreciated,
and I stayed around them guys.
Beans,
and
spaghetti,
I guess.
Oh,
they can.
Yeah.
And,
um,
they must have can openers,
one.
I think everybody
had can openers.
Um,
they had these little wee
portable can openers,
you know,
that you just
hook on,
and turn,
turn the thing around,
around,
cut it off.
Yeah.
They had a knife,
anyhow.
Maybe I opened them
with a knife,
I don't remember.
Maybe they had can openers.
Yeah.
They must have had
a can opener,
too.
Uh,
in these,
um,
these cans,
uh,
10 and 1,
or something,
they used to have
big,
quite a lot of,
uh,
food,
enough for 10 men,
in one container.
Oh.
And they each had,
them each had
a can opener in it.
It was one of these
little can openers.
Yeah.
Little ones,
it was just real small.
Right,
and it has the
twister pretty much.
Yeah.
And,
uh,
so the Jews
put the can openers
around once we was
in the army,
there was.
Oh.
But,
uh,
so I eat with them guys,
and I just stayed
around with them.
And,
uh,
instead of these
other guys
I had been traveling
with.
Didn't you get
pictures from
healing?
Oh,
I,
no,
I told them that I,
and didn't,
and he told me
to help myself.
Oh,
there were other guys
people.
Oh,
no,
they didn't know it.
And I didn't,
and I couldn't
very well take it
from these guys
and give it to them,
my own guys.
So I was picky,
I ate it myself.
He was pretty good
looking out for the name.
Scroungin.
I always wondered
where I got that.
Uh-oh,
talking about
scroungin,
the same outfit
that we were,
had been in,
they,
uh,
they,
uh,
these two,
same two officers,
I think they were
planning,
selling the stuff
to French black market.
The Jews?
Yeah,
they were both Jews.
Not that,
not a Jew
is worse than anybody else,
but they,
uh,
I think they planned
on selling it.
That's why they didn't
give us anything.
Were the French people
starving or something?
Oh,
yeah,
they were glad
to buy stuff.
Hmm.
And,
uh,
I,
well,
we were there
one night,
uh,
they had
our tent
guarding.
They'd change around
and have different
tents guarding.
And,
uh,
guarding what?
Guarding the camp,
the camp,
our area.
Well,
I was,
uh,
near where
the supply tent
was.
They had a supply
tent that they
had store stuff in.
And they were
just a little,
a little tent
about the big
of this room.
I did eat in there,
too.
And,
uh,
I got in there
and to see
what was in there
and,
uh,
there was
these number
ten cans
of peaches.
There was
quite a few
of them
and,
and
canned milk
so I hauled
a can of that
down to the tent,
to our tent.
Milk and peaches?
Yeah,
milk and peaches.
I took quite a lot
of milk.
I was greedy
about the milk.
You know,
we ate,
uh,
uh,
we had enough milk,
canned milk,
to use to eat
peaches up
and we all
ate them up.
I bet they were
off to these
last four.
Oh,
they were happy
about it.
And,
I was...
How many
were in your tent?
Uh,
seven.
And,
uh,
we ate that
and,
uh,
boy,
were they
happy peaches
and cream.
What is,
what's a number
ten can a gallon?
Well,
they ain't quite a gallon,
it's just these big cans.
And,
um,
the milk,
see,
I had taken quite a lot
of milk
and I dug a hole
under my bunk
and,
uh,
see,
just had dirt floors
and I,
these,
uh,
canvas cots
is what we slept on.
I dug a hole
under there
and
put this canned milk
down in there.
a hole
that we didn't use.
Uh,
the other guys
didn't know
how much milk
we had or it.
You see,
at that time
we didn't have
any light
in the tent
or anything.
It was dark,
you know,
in the tent.
You could do
like one
without the others
knowing it.
And,
I dug this hole
and I put the,
it was clay ground
and,
uh,
I put that
milk down in there
and laid a cardboard
over it
and put dirt
on top of the cardboard
so that you just
couldn't tell
if there was anything
disturbed.
Did you have a shovel?
You could do?
Yeah,
we had a
trenching tool.
Oh.
And,
so that,
How'd you dispose
of the cans?
Oh,
you could take them out
and bury them
right back in the hole.
or take them out
and throw them
in the garbage pit.
Nobody watched
you so close
that you'd get in trouble.
Oh,
you could do that
when it was easy.
When it was dark,
when it was dark
you had to watch yourself.
You know,
they had dug
this deep hole
while he feed deep
for the slop and stuff
to go in
from the kitchen
and the trash
and everything else.
There one guy
was walking
across there
at night
and fell in that hole.
He was swimming around
in that deep hole.
And,
somebody went
and fished him out.
Well,
then they put a
string around it
to keep him out
and fall in.
Gross.
What a mess.
It would be all
rotten food
and stuff.
Oh, yeah.
You'd be,
well,
there wouldn't be
much scraps
because they didn't
give us enough
to leave any scraps
on it.
That's true.
It was,
one time
there was slop.
They had
a boy there
that,
I guess he was
the 70th Adventist.
And,
he says,
I don't want
none of that meat.
and they slopped
it on his plate,
on his tray,
I mean,
on his mess kit.
Anyhow.
And,
and that,
they were,
cooks was bad
about that,
about mixing up
your food.
They didn't try to,
try to keep it separate.
They'd just slop it on
so you just had
garbage
when you looked like.
he dumped it in the garbage
can and they
court-martialed him
for it.
Really?
Huh.
What kind of meat
was it?
Fork.
Did you
squeeze it up,
kind of?
I'd take the pork
and I'd give it
to the other guys.
They were,
they were glad
to get it.
It kind of made me
a favorite guy
around there.
He didn't,
let them share
my pork.
Well,
you probably didn't get
enough meat
on those days at all.
Well,
I was the scrum's,
you know,
though.
Oh, that's true.
You should go get
some more meat today.
No,
it was just the one time
that we were on guard.
You know,
it's a funny thing,
they must not have
been paying attention
to how much stuff
they had
because
the
next night
there was another
tent
on guard
and
the next morning
after that,
after they were
on guard,
they made a raid
on them.
Because they had
taken a bunch?
Whether they had
taken some
or not,
but they went there
and they
shook them down
and looked
and all they found
was a wrapper
of
this bullion
tube wrapper.
It was a
foil
or some
kind of wrapper.
That was the only
thing they found
in them guys' tent
so that
that wasn't
conclusive evidence
to court-martial
the whole tent
over.
They just
bawled them out
about it.
And I think
they hadn't
noticed it.
They hadn't
noticed it.
Hadn't noticed
anything there
until,
oh,
I had taken
a can of that
bullion
cubes too.
That'd be good
in water
and you could
make water.
But I didn't
use them.
I didn't like
them just in
water.
If you put it
in a soup
it was different.
I never opened
a can.
I gave it
to a tailor
to cut my
jacket down
to fit me
better.
My
wool jacket.
Where is that?
Where?
In France?
In France,
yeah.
Yeah,
to a French
town at the same
time?
Well,
this was after
I wasn't even
there at that
place.
You bawled it
with you?
I did that
way.
Yeah,
I had it
with me.
Yeah.
I had it
buried too
until,
you know,
in this home
until I,
you know,
removed.
And,
um,
I would
take this
milk and
I would
drink that
milk up
early,
in the morning,
you know,
before or
while everybody
was sleeping,
I'd pour it
in my canteen
and then fill it
with water
and I'd be
drinking milk
all day long.
One canteen.
I'd make a quart
out of each
can.
You know,
you know,
I'd be drinking
milk.
I'd be just
drinking out of
a canteen.
one of the
guys that
was with
us there,
a Jew
fellow
from Miami,
he told
the others
that he
wanted me
to work
for him
after we
got out
of the
army.
And he
didn't say
why,
and I
was off
and running
wondering
what kind
of business
he had
that he
wanted a
thief to
work for.
What about
the light bulb?
Oh.
Well,
as we
went along
in these
tents,
they wouldn't
have no
lights.
And what
were you doing
here?
What was your
purpose there?
Just sitting
and waiting
for orders?
Waiting
until they
set up a
hospital
someplace
where we
could be
doing
something
at the
hospital.
Well,
how did
they decide
you were
going to
be in
a
hospital?
Had
medical
training.
You
didn't
know you
were
in
upstairs?
Oh,
see,
no,
they didn't
want
nurses
anyhow.
See,
when they
shipped us
to El Paso,
Texas,
we went
to a
hospital,
we had
medical
training.
For how
long?
Because
you
were
in
upstairs?
A
lot
of
them
wasn't
these
objectors.
A lot
of them
that
were
taking
this
medical
training,
right at
the time
they
were
planning
this,
taking
Europe.
And
so that
they
was
training
and
almost
everybody
went
to be
medics.
They
figured
they'd
need
a
lot
of
medics.
And
So
you
trained
in
a
hospital
in
Texas?
Yeah,
William
Beaumont
Hospital up
on the
mountain
from
El
Paso,
just east
of El
Paso.
We
missed that
whole
part.
We
had it
easy
then.
During
basic
training
everybody
was hard
boil,
the Army
was.
And
after we
got up
there,
everybody
was nice.
You
could
pretty
well
do
like
you
wanted
to.
and
I
we
this
was
advanced
medical
training.
See
we
had
some
before
that
too.
But
this
was
advanced
and
they
tried
to
make
a
doctor
out
of
you
in
just
what
time
they
had
in
three
months
and
they
really
crammed
you.
They
did?
Like
what?
All
kinds
of
doctor
stuff.
Really?
Yeah,
how to
operate
and
stuff.
They
knew
we
wouldn't
be
doing
it.
What
were
you
called?
Surgical
what?
Technician.
Huh.
It was
just
to
help
doctors.
So
you
had
to
help
do
operations
at
the
hospital?
I
didn't
know
but
that's
the
training
I
had.
You
watched?
I
watched
some.
Any
figures
you
could
do?
We
had
the
opportunity
to watch
all the
operations
or a
lot
of
them
if
we
wanted
to
but
I
was
working
otherwise.
They
had
a
cafeteria
there
and
it
was
run
by
civilian
help
at
night.
It
was
army
run
but
civilian
helped
run
it
in
the
daytime
and
the
army
would
do it
at
night.
I
saw a
boy
go down
the road
there
each
night
to the
hospital.
Our
camp was
above
the
hospital.
I
said
where
did you
go down
there?
He
said
go down
there
work
at
the
cafeteria.
I
said
I'll
go
along
with
you.
I
started
going
along
with
him.
He
cooked
down
there.
Fry
cook.
I
went
down
there
and
there
was
an
army
officer
or
sergeant
in
charge
of
us.
Yeah,
he put
me to
work.
So you
worked
at the
hospital
during
the
day
in
the
cafeteria
at
night?
Yeah,
I
take
training
during
the
day.
I
worked
until
about
11 o'clock
or so
at
night.
Dollar
and a
half
a
night.
Oh,
you
got
paid?
Yeah,
and all
you
could
eat.
French
vinegar.
But they
fed us
there at
the
hospital.
And
after
camp.
And
so
I
worked
there
first
I
was
waiting
on
tables
and
then
they
stopped
waiting
on
tables.
Let
everybody
come
and
get
their
own.
And
then
the
dishwasher
quit.
The
guy
that
was
washing
dishes.
And
so
I
got
his
job.
And
I
liked
that
better
than
waiting
on
tables
anyhow.
And
it
was
one
of
these
steam
washers.
And
I
had
it
easy.
I
worked
there
the rest
of the
time
I
was
there.
You
were
only
supposed
to
do
so
much
a
week.
So
many
nights
a
week.
You
couldn't
work
every
night.
But
right
toward
the
last
he
said
you
have
already
put
in
too
much
time.
I
said
well
I
am
going
to
be
shipping
out.
So
he
let
me
stay
several
more
days
until
we
shipped
out.
Then
they
moved
us
from
there
to
do
some
finishing
stuff
on
us
training
where
we
would
be
charge
of
a
ward
in
an
annex
they
had.
So
they
moved
us
down
there
to
an
annex.
everybody
didn't
get
the
same
training
really.
And
I
was
on
12
hours
on
12
hours
off.
And
here
what relieved
me,
I called
up the
office
and
said
where's
the
relief
and
they
said
oh
the guy
didn't
show
up.
And
so
I'll
find
somebody
and
then
I
called
later
and
still
not
showed
up.
And
still
nobody
showed
up.
He
says
you'll
just
have
to
stay
all
night.
So
all
night.
But
I
slept
I
didn't
stay
awake
all
night.
Nobody
needed
anything?
No.
I
was
on
a
skin
disease
more.
The
whole
skin
disease.
I
come
off
scratching
myself
to
death.
It
was
just
to
bite
rough
and
other
ues
have
to
—
to
start
out
into
》
into
so
we
can
see
you
know
or
at
you
