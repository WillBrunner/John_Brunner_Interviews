Is it going? Well, George, he was odd-headed when he was quite young. He was certainly brown and blue-eyed and he was put in issues. He wouldn't take anything off of him.
One time, after he came home from the hospital and he got to where he could walk with crutches, because at first he couldn't walk at all.
Of course, he'd been kept on his back for years, three years.
And I'd carried him out, put him in a wagon and wheel him around, and he's bigger than he's heavier than he's heavier than I was talking about.
I had gained on him because he didn't, he was just kind of shorter after he got sick.
And Paul and Laura got him a new pair of shoes. He was walking with these crutches and he wore one shoe crook. He dragged it or something.
And so he took hobnails and he put all on that shoe to keep them from wearing right at that spot.
That's what he did? Yeah. And Laura's seen what he did and she said, you just take him off!
And she got the whip back, the quirk. He went right after her and took that whip away from her.
George, you did? Yeah. And he couldn't hardly walk.
But she later got the shoes and tore them out herself. She was an honest neighbor. Overfairing.
We should never have put up with that. We should never have put up with that.
But Paul threatened to send us to Morganza if we didn't mind her.
You could have made her life a little miserable.
Morganza was the boy's reformator. He did?
Yeah, he threatened to send us there if we didn't behave. And that was not behaving if we talked back to her.
The job could have probably changed her up. He could have made her life miserable.
We should never pull that stuff off. One time, Clarence, there was some neighbors of ours, they were having a party.
And they invited the whole community to come to the party. Kids especially, but anybody could come.
This was in Pennsylvania?
Yeah, Pennsylvania. And they had a wiener roast and other stuff.
I didn't even know nothing about the party until afterwards. And some other kids and I had a dinner roast.
You didn't just go to the party?
No, because I didn't even know. We didn't.
No, because they were invited, maybe.
We didn't go. Anyhow, we were down there and around the fire and having a good time and roasting potatoes.
And they'd get so excited.
But it just stopped.
We were roasting them potatoes.
And then I went home and boy, dear Laura met me out the door with the quirt and whacked me.
And then she said, what did you go over to that party for?
I didn't know anything about the party.
Well, then she stopped.
Then they told me about the party, she and Paul.
Had they gone?
And Paul would let her do stuff like that, too.
And they sent me over to get Clarence.
Where was he?
Over at the party.
Oh.
How?
Well, I went over there and I told him that he was supposed to come home.
And he had a wiener that they had roasted.
Or he had roasted.
And he offered me half it.
And I said, no, you need it.
Boy, I felt sorry for him.
Did he get whipped?
She beat him half to death.
I shouldn't have let her do it.
I should have stepped in and stopped her.
Paul should have stopped her.
Because she didn't like them neighbors.
I don't know if kids should stick up for their rights.
I should have stuck up for the rights of him.
Yeah.
One time he was down in the cellar and I had carried coal.
Who was Clarence?
Clarence was.
I had carried coal and every time I wanted to be doing something, you better get some more
coal.
It'll soon be out.
I had filled that cellar hole clean up to the ceiling with lumps of coal and put smaller
stuff behind it and all the lumps like a wall.
And I built this wall, two sides of it, to shut off that corner of the cellar.
And Clarence was down in the cellar and he wasn't near the coal.
Put the wall give away and let that stuff spill out on the floor.
It's like coal.
You know, it slid out.
She started after him for doing it.
And he ran off.
And she waited up for him that night.
He came in about 11 o'clock and boy, did she beat him.
How old was he?
I don't know.
Seven or eight.
What would she beat him once?
Of course.
That's what you whip a horse with?
Yeah.
It's a riding flip.
I bet it about brought blood.
No, I don't think so, but it would sure give wells.
Well, did you guys ever think about burning that thing?
No, but...
One time...
Well, I was supposed to whip me or something.
And she...
She had told him to whip me.
I don't even know what it was.
But...
I don't know what it was.
I don't know what it was.
I don't know what it was.
That's what you whip a horse with?
That's what you whip a horse with?
Yeah.
It's a riding flip.
I bet it about brought blood.
No, I don't think so, but it would sure give...
No.
But...
Uh...
One time...
Well, I was supposed to whip me or something.
And she...
She had told him to whip me.
I don't even know what it was for.
Maybe for nothing.
I don't know.
Anyhow...
Uh...
He got the whip out, and he swung that at me.
But before it hit me, I grabbed it.
Just with my hand.
I was fourteen.
And...
Uh...
Let loose of that whip.
And he was twisting on it and kicking at me.
And I just hung onto that whip with just one hand.
And he was twisting, twisting.
Uh...
Finally he quit.
I don't think his heart was in it any time.
And I took it in and hung it up.
And that was the last time.
He never...
He never laid a hand on me after that.
He thought about it, but he never did.
And uh...
And she...
She figured this out was too much.
So...
But did they still beat on Clarence then?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
We shouldn't have stood out.
We shouldn't have left.
Hmm.
Let's skip to the hotel.
A little more than right.
Huh?
Um...
Georgie, uh...
Used to get him in the wagon and push him around.
He'd steer the wagon and push him all around the country.
We'd go for miles.
And we'd push him and we'd steer.
How old were you guys?
Uh...
I don't know.
How old was he when you got sick?
11, yes I was.
He was 12.
Yeah.
Twelve and a half.
And uh...
When did he get sick?
He was kind of scared.
He wondered about the Red Cross at Mercy.
We were kind of on to the Red Cross.
They're the ones that got him in the hospital.
Uh...
That's my dad didn't.
He couldn't afford anything.
We were barely making a living.
Was it necessary for him to go to the hospital?
No.
I mean, if he wasn't going to get better, what did they do for him?
They probably helped the pain.
Uh...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
Did he get one of the dope or no?
I don't know.
He didn't use dope a lot of plastic.
Some people did.
Uh...
We...
Pushed him around and there one day...
He nursed the kid.
He was supposed to be in bed.
He had to dress on it.
Yeah.
And, uh...
They'd bring dressings and things sometimes.
And, uh...
He...
Uh...
Um...
She caught us.
And...
And she says,
Oh, that's nice that you push him around and...
Out in the sunshine because that's good for him.
Oh.
Because he was happy to cut it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well then he got, uh...
He got...
Somebody get him in a wheelchair.
And he used that wheelchair.
He could wheel it around and in and out.
And I'd miss him even when I was at school.
We were closer than any other kids.
And, uh...
I...
Uh...
I...
I told him...
To reach that time,
Come out on the porch and wave to him.
So you can...
See, I could see the house from the school.
It was quite a little ways, but I could look down...
You know, you had to go down the valley for the creek and then cross the creek to get to our place and...
I could look across there and see him on the porch.
But, how far or another, he didn't see me waving or something.
He couldn't have gone with you to school?
No.
He started afterwards.
Uh...
When...
He got to where he could walk on crutches, he started school.
Uh...
And he was several grades behind me by that time.
Uh...
So he had to stay home with Laura all this time?
Uh...
Just some of the time.
See, some of the time...
Most of the time, it was Annie's search course app.
That was a girl.
My dad hired her for...
He should have married her.
Uh...
He wanted to marry Laura.
Instead of Laura.
He should have talked her into marrying...
She didn't want...
She had a boyfriend.
Well, he was too beautiful older than she was.
Oh.
She was...
I don't...
I don't know how old she was.
She was about Bill's age, I suppose.
Oh, she was young then.
Yeah.
And, uh...
She was real nice.
I had a good trip.
And I...
And never...
There was never any fussing between us and...
Never.
Right.
She got along with us.
We papered the house.
Wallpapered the house.
And she helped do it.
Whose idea was that?
It was, I guess.
I guess he bought the paper.
Oh, that was white.
I don't remember.
And, uh...
And, uh...
Any search, she couldn't help.
And...
A neighbor girl would come in.
She liked having like Bill.
Mary Lawson.
She'd come in and help.
And...
Oh, we had a good time paper in the house.
I bet you did.
Bill...
Bill and the class didn't help.
We chased her out.
Uh...
This was in the summer.
We wasn't going to school.
And they started she was a good cook and a good helper around the place.
She got three dollars a week.
Hmm.
She'd come after breakfast.
She'd wash the breakfast dishes.
Cooked dinner.
And, uh...
And help around the place.
Cleaned the house.
Ain't scrubbing or anything to do.
She didn't.
She was a Russian girl.
Hmm.
And, uh...
She'd, uh...
And she'd cook supper.
And...
And eat with us.
She'd get her with us.
And we'd eat supper with us.
And then she'd wash up the dishes.
And then go home.
Was your dad home for lunch or just...
Yeah, he'd come home for lunch.
What kind of stuff would she cook?
Would she cook Russian food?
Yeah.
Really?
She said she didn't know how to cook in the American language.
But she could cook...
She could cook in her language.
What did she make?
Well, I said, it's alright.
Cook whatever you want.
Well, he was used to having...
Elmerberry pie and burned beans.
Worse than that.
He'd have died with indigestion in a very short time.
It wasn't for any thirsty.
So what did she make?
Oh, she'd fry beans.
Fried beans?
Fried green beans.
Oh, oh.
That was something I'd never eaten before.
Fried beans.
Really good?
Oh, yeah.
Real good.
And she made potato pancakes.
Oh.
And she'd grate them potatoes.
And I don't know what else she'd do with them.
And then she'd fry them in the patties.
I bet that was good.
Oh, they were good.
And probably really went for them.
And, uh, I don't know what else she cooked.
One time she found some, uh, corn, uh, what do you call it when you use lye with it?
Hominy.
Hominy.
Hominy flakes.
Hominy flakes.
We had a bag of hominy flakes for that and we hadn't been using them.
And, uh, Annie found them in the kitchen and said, what is that?
And I said, the hominy flakes.
She said, how do you cook them?
And I said, you just cook them first and then you fry them.
Did you know?
Uh, yeah.
And, uh, cook it in the mush and then slice it and fry it when it's cold.
But I didn't explain altogether how to do it, I guess.
And when she, uh, did it, she stirred it all up.
She only cooked it once, I believe, because maybe she didn't fare too much for it.
She stirred it all up and then fried it instead of slicing it.
Oh, I see.
So it just tastes different even.
It was kind of lumpy then.
Mm-hmm.
But we had it.
We had everything she cooked.
Uh-huh.
What was her name?
Annie what?
Annie Surchik.
Surchik?
Surchik.
Uh-huh.
Her younger sister was in my grade, Katie.
Uh, she'd come with her one Saturday when she'd come to work.
And, you know, she worked six days a week.
She didn't come on Sunday.
But she'd work six days a week.
And she'd come with her one day, and, uh, Annie was gonna make soup.
And Katie just loved the good soup.
Oh, I've heard that before.
She'd only come to one day.
What kind of soup did she make?
I don't remember what it was, but she—it was always good soup, though.
She'd make soup different times.
Uh-huh.
And it was always good.
Uh-huh.
She didn't get in a rut.
She'd cook different things.
I can't remember about any desserts.
So was Georgie in the hospital when your dad married Laura, or what?
Uh, no.
No, huh.
Georgie had come home, and that's why he got Annie there.
Uh-huh.
So she'd have somebody there with him.
Well, how'd you know anything was wrong with Georgie to begin with?
Start hurting.
His bones hurt, or his skin, or all that?
Uh-huh.
Some kind of infection in him, and it was a pain.
And his legs?
Did I say about going to school?
You know, the other thing.
Oh.
Well, I'd go to school for it, and he got so bad that, uh, one morning we were late.
Oh.
And, uh, did I say that?
Yeah.
Oh.
But tell—if it—if it leads up to about any—
Well, you know, he was—he got to where he was so bad that he had to stay home.
Well, then—
He—
How old were you?
Annie wasn't there.
Right.
Then about now.
Annie got there later than that, because, uh—oh, oh, yeah.
Nobody was home at that time.
This was before—way before Annie was there.
Before he went to the hospital.
Yeah.
He, uh—
About the time that you—
He got to where he just couldn't walk.
And, uh, so he stayed home.
A little.
Or, uh—or just a little.
Well, you said he worked with your Uncle Walter, and then he came home because it was time for school to start.
And then he started school that year.
He must have gotten sick sometime that winter?
Or in the spring?
That winter, yeah.
That winter, yeah.
He got sick.
He got sick.
Um.
Then he, uh—they took the Red Cross—somehow or another, my dad got his cross news of it, and they got him in the hospital in Pittsburgh.
And they—he, uh—my dad didn't have to pay at all.
I guess the Red Cross just got it through sometimes.
What did he do all the time?
Did you get to go visit him at all or anything?
One time, Pa said we could go, uh—we'd go and, uh—bills.
I don't know what Bill was doing.
I don't know what Bill was doing.
Bill was going to go with us.
He was probably working.
Probably after he started working.
Like all mine.
Anyhow, uh—we went up to Old Dad Martin's.
He was, uh—my step-grandfather.
Um, we went up there and spent the night in my grandmother's place up in the hills.
Up above, before we lived.
That was your mother's—
My mother's mother.
My mother's mother.
You're dead.
Your grandma.
My mother's mother.
Your mother's step-father.
And we stayed overnight with them.
And I remember her grandma saying, uh, does any of the kids wet the bed?
And my dad says, no.
And—I don't know when the parents was in the habit of wetting the bed.
I didn't think so at that time, but he developed it later.
Maybe it was Laura got in the bed.
Right.
No, no.
He was wetting the bed before Laura.
Anyhow, I was—he and I were sleeping together in the bed, and oh, you know, a warm bath.
And I wondered what grandma thought the next day to find that bed wet.
Was it a feather bed?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
She wouldn't have known who done it, or maybe—
She probably thought you did it.
Maybe she was supposed to—both figured both of us were supposed to be to play.
I don't know.
Anyhow, uh, in the morning, uh, my old dad, Morgan, he had a Model T Ford.
And he took us to the streetcar lot.
And I don't know where this streetcar line started from, whether it was Harmony, or whether
it was Irwin.
Anyhow, we got on the streetcar, and, uh, that was my first experience with a streetcar.
What is it?
What are they like?
It's just a car with, uh, running electricity on the railroad track.
It had a big—
It had a thing with a wheel on it that's running its track up above.
Oh.
And, uh, I was looking out at the window and the boss said,
Keep your head in, and I would have hit a pole.
He must have thought I had a long neck.
Anyhow, uh, that—that went to Pittsburgh.
I don't know where it started from, but it might have started from Hermony and went to Pittsburgh.
Anyhow, we got to Pittsburgh.
Or did we take a train and train?
Did we take a train?
Maybe we took a train from someplace.
I can't remember.
Anyhow, we got to the hospital.
And, uh, Paul went in, and they wouldn't let us get there.
Oh, man.
But they did wheel his bed out onto the porch.
It was a screen porch, and we could talk through the screen porch, and it was up above on the second store.
That's so dumb.
And, uh, they wouldn't let him bring him outside or anything.
Then that same trip, after we'd seen him, uh, they, uh,
Pa took us to the Island Park Zoo in Pittsburgh.
It's still operating.
Yeah.
And maybe it's a pretty good zoo now, but it wasn't too good then.
They had dead snakes in there and stuff.
They didn't take care of that.
They were very good, and they didn't have very many animals.
But anyhow, it was something for us, because we hadn't seen any zoo before that.
Then we went home, and we walked from...
That was...
That streetcar did run to Harmony, because we walked from Harmony, about three miles, back home.
But...
Well, it would have been three miles by the way of the road, but...
I saw new shortcuts through fields and woods and stuff.
And...
Then another time, quite a long time after that, they said Georgie could come home.
And Pa went to get him.
I bet you were excited.
He thought that he could get him home.
He wanted him home, I guess.
Anyhow, he got up there and he wouldn't release him.
But...
He's gone all day.
He'd gone...
Pretty early in the morning.
And...
He was gone all day, and I remember getting out...
And...
Sitting...
Feel dark...
Watching for him come.
Because you thought he was going to bring him.
Yeah.
And they didn't let him come.
And...
And...
Well, then finally, when they did say he could come home...
I guess they figured he was going to go home and die.
And it had been a long, long time?
How long had it been?
Well, he was in there three years.
Okay.
And...
Um...
When the...
Uh...
Army got him.
He got Walter to go get him.
Walter had a...
Truck of some kind.
Like a pickup truck with a canopy over it.
And the roof was solid.
And it had wire side plugs.
And...
And...
He...
He got...
Walter...
They had a bed in the back of it.
And they brought in...
He brought him home.
And...
Uh...
Bar was...
I'd like...
Uh...
And this was...
Uh...
It just led up to when he...
Started walking.
Was he excited to see you guys, too?
Uh...
Uh...
Oh, yeah.
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Oh, yeah.
He was glad to be home.
At least some of the time.
I don't know.
He didn't have as good food as he had in the hospital and that stuff.
But...
He...
He was...
Glad to be home.
He the one that threw his food on the floor for the dog?
No.
That was...
When was that?
About that time?
When was that when Laura was...
It never hit the floor.
One time...
We had pork chops.
And...
Was it after Laura?
Pork chops was about that size.
No.
That was before Laura.
And he searched for one there either.
I guess Bill could...
Anyhow...
Uh...
He says...
I want a bigger piece than that.
Paul says...
Eat that.
And then you get...
Maybe get some more.
And...
It was pretty small to start with.
And...
He says...
I want more.
He says...
I'll just give it the dog.
He says...
I'll just give it the dog.
He says...
The dog is...
She...
Caught up and swallowed it.
Who is...
What dog was that?
Topsy.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
That one.
I never told you about the...
Airedale dog.
Oh.
That one.
I never told you about the...
Airedale dog.
Yeah, you did...
Topsy?
Yeah.
That she learned to pull...
I mean on this tape.
She learned to pull...
Yeah.
Yeah, you told about her.
Oh.
Did she swallow...
Was he intended to throw her?
Or did the dog get it out?
No.
He brought it to her.
She caught it there.
And he didn't get a beating for that?
And he didn't...
No.
He didn't get some more at all.
So...
The clarification you do...
He'd get away with that.
How?
With your dad?
With my dad.
He could?
My dad would just laugh at him.
Then when he'd do something on you.
That's horrible.
He'd laugh.
That's horrible.
Didn't he do cartwheels or something?
To get out and get in a beat once or something?
And he'd get part of laughing.
By what?
Oh, he'd just do something funny and...
Get part of laughing.
Paul wouldn't get bothered.
He'd take it out.
He'd get laughing.
I don't know.
He did?
He looked like him.
Well, what else would he do?
Did he look like your mom?
Did Clarence look like your mom or something?
He had blonde hair and blue eyes.
Well, Georgie did do that, didn't he?
Yeah, Georgie did.
The rest of us was...
Dark hair and...
Dark hair.
Dark hair.
Dark hair.
So, tell more about Georgie then.
Oh, let's see.
One time, Georgie would walk with one crutch.
And he liked to have the rubber on the bottom of it.
And we didn't have any cups to put on, or rubber cups to put on.
And he...
He decided that, uh, if he had a good furl on the bottom of that...
What's the furl?
Uh...
A round piece of metal.
Uh...
To slip right on it.
And have the bottom part hollow.
And he...
He'd just cut a piece of automobile tire and put in there for the bottom.
In that hollow.
See, the furl would go part way onto the crutch.
Yeah.
And then he'd...
He'd cut that...
Cut that...
Put it in.
So that...
That bottom was kind of heavy.
I don't think he'd ever wrote...
Read...
Uh...
Treasure Island.
But...
Captain...
Maybe he'd see somebody in the hospital with one like that.
What...
What was the captain's name in there?
Long John?
Crutch.
Long John Silver.
Um...
He...
He could throw that crutch and...
Georgie did?
No.
Well, we're talking about Long John Silver.
He threw that thing and...
And he hit a guy.
I don't know if it killed him or not.
But...
He could...
He could throw his crutch.
Well, I don't think Georgie had ever read Treasure Island.
But anyhow...
Uh...
One day...
We was going home from school.
And a kid threw a snowball.
And he hit Georgie in the back of the head.
And...
It was a kid that was farther back than the one he threw that crutch at.
He...
He...
He...
He...
He turned...
And threw that crutch.
And it just spiraled like an arrow.
Right over that kid's head.
He ducked.
He says, I didn't do it.
It was another kid that they throw at the snowball.
And...
And...
And...
Like he didn't mean it.
Boy, it was sure a good thing it didn't.
If it hit him, it was hard.
And...
Because of that...
He had the blacksmith make that furrow part.
Oh, he did have that on there.
Yeah.
He made that.
And...
It was...
That bottom was heavy.
He made it out of a piece of heavy metal.
Hmm.
He was a good blacksmith.
He was...
He was a nice fellow.
I used to think it would be nice to be a blacksmith myself.
I'd go down there and watch him sharpen picks and making stuff.
Uh...
What was his name?
Uh...
He married Van Dyke.
What's his pick?
They used pick... coal picks to dig for coal.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
He worked for the mine.
He sharpened the augers and the picks.
And the company would charge for it, but he worked for wedges.
And, uh...
He charged the miners for it.
Yeah.
And, uh...
And, uh...
And, uh...
And, uh...
And, uh...
The company would charge for it, but he worked for wedges.
And, uh...
And, uh...
And, uh...
And, uh...
He charged the miners to leave a pick, you know.
And he had the...
Oh, right.
Turned in, you know, that way.
Uh...
And he shod the horses, too.
Did he use horses?
He could make horses and stuff.
Did they use horses?
Did they use horses and mules?
Mules.
Mules and horses, yeah.
That guy...
That guy that you wrote up there was...
He planned a church.
Um...
I'm lucky why you liked that, um...
village blacksmith's poem.
I don't know.
It's like poetry anyhow.
I used to help Georgie with poetry some.
Ah, if you think of any poems, recite them on here, too.
Um...
Georgie...
Uh...
We had a teacher that...
With, uh...
She was a stickler for poetry.
Um...
I could learn poetry easily.
Uh...
Not because I was smart, but because I was dumb.
It's just...
Poetry come my way.
And...
I like poetry.
And then...
I could, uh...
When I'd get a...
When I'd get a...
She's a teacher with a sign of home to us.
I would, uh...
Read maybe at school.
And then I'd read it at home maybe a time or two.
And then just before I'd go to bed, I'd read it again.
And then my mind would work on that during the night, and I'd know it in the morning.
Really?
I could...
Read it over again in the morning to make sure that...
He had it.
And it went.
And I would have it.
And, uh...
So, Georgie, he...
He didn't want to learn poetry.
And I used to help him some on it.
Because I was the head of him in school anyhow.
And I'd also help him on...
Diagram.
He didn't understand the diagram in English.
Yeah.
And I'd help him on the diagram.
Because I kind of knew verbs and stuff.
I don't know how I knew them because I was...
Because I'm otherwise.
Teachers couldn't teach me anything.
But anyhow...
I did.
I did.
I did.
I did.
Help Georgie off.
Uh...
What were some of the poems you got you memorized?
Oh...
You know exactly.
Um...
Let's not wait before that.
And that, uh...
I have them written down.
That schoolhouse.
Schoolhouse.
Schoolhouse.
Oh, I like that.
Uh...
One...
One of our teachers...
That same teacher.
It was for poetry.
Boy...
She put on skits with, uh...
Especially the schoolhouse by the road.
She would?
Yeah.
And she'd have the kids doing it.
Well, recite it.
Um...
How do you start?
Still fit.
Still fit.
Still fit.
The schoolhouse by the road.
The rugged beggars running.
Around it still, the shoemax girls and black guys hide their riddle.
Within the master's desk is seen deep scars by raps officials.
The walking floor.
The battered feet.
The jackknife scarred initial.
Charcoal frescoes on its wall.
The door is worn.
Still betraying.
The peak is creeping slow to school when it's storming out of the play.
Long years ago, a winter sun shone over it at setting, lit up its western window panes,
and lilies as icy fredding.
The touch span of golden churnals and brown eyes full of crevies, of one who still, her
steps delayed when all the schools were leaving.
The touch span of golden churnals and brown eyes full of crevies, of one who still, her
steps delayed when all the schools were leaving.
For near her stood a little boy, her childish spader singled, his cap full of apocrys, and
a little boy who still, her steps delayed when all the schools were leaving.
The touch span of golden churnals and brown eyes full of crevies, of one who still, her
steps delayed when all the schools were leaving.
For near her stood a little boy, her childish spader singled, his cap full of a pawnee's
face where pride and shame were going for.
Pushing with restless feet the snow to right and left he lingered, and restlessly her tiny
hand, the blue-checked apron, lingered.
He saw her lips raw.
He felt the soft hands light caressing.
He heard the tremble of the voice, as if a false confessor.
I'm sorry that I felt the word.
I hate to go above you.
Yet, because the brown eyes lower fell, because you see I love you.
Still memory to the gray-haired man in the sweet, childish space and short, and dear
girl of the grass is on her grave, had forty years to be known.
He lives to learn in life's hard school, how few the path above you, lament their triumph
at his loss.
I cared because of nothing.
Is that Longfellow?
Longfellow, yeah.
I like that.
I like that, too.
So did Georgie have to learn that one?
I don't remember.
So she would do skits of that?
Yeah.
How would she do it?
Have somebody reading it, and somebody else doing it.
Oh, her.
Oh, she was a pretty good teacher, I guess, but she had her favorites.
She did?
Oh, Georgie had a book of Longfellow's poems, and I bought it from her.
I think he sold it to me for ten cents.
That was then?
It was kind of raggy, you know.
And I took that to school, and that teacher knew I had it, and I'd keep it in my desk.
I thought a lot of times I'd read it when I was supposed to be learning something else.
And the teacher, she borrowed from me.
And here, one day, I reached in under the desk, you know, under the desk, there was a shelf,
there were your books, and I reached out and that book was gone.
And boy, I told the teacher, my book is gone.
She says, I have it.
I had one of the kids go get it for me.
She didn't keep it though, right?
No, no.
Just borrowed it?
No, she just borrowed it to me.
Huh.
Well, she must have liked you because you liked poetry so much.
Well, I don't know if she did or not.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Uh, she, uh, she got me a book from the library, David Copperfield.
And it's a great, they broke 900 pages.
Uh, she got it from the library and had me read it.
You read it?
Yeah, and then she had me give a book.
There's too much of a book to give a book.
It's a life thing.
How long, how old were you?
I was in, uh, fifth and sixth grade with that same teacher.
She taught fifth and sixth.
So you read the book and gave a book report?
Yeah, well, it was pretty much the bridge by the time I gave it.
Was it an interesting book?
Yeah, it was actually about David Copperfield's, or Dickinson's wife.
I mean life.
Uh, Dickinson was the author of it, Charles Dickinson.
Uh-huh.
Uh, and it was pretty much his life that he wrote that about.
At least that's what I gathered from him.
Well, what else can we talk about?
I don't know.
Anything you feel like.
We all can we run down.
We all can we run down.
Anything you feel like.
We just keep talking about anything.
Any stories.
Or anything.
Either way, you know, she was overburied, that teacher.
Pennsylvania and them teachers could do anything and get away with.
Is she the one?
No, that old man is the one that he did.
Yeah.
And, uh, I can remember them names.
Uh, sometimes.
Uh, she, uh, one time she was having a spell down.
She had to have them quite a bit.
Spell down and then in English things, uh, reading English or something.
And the first one made a mistake.
You had to get down and stuff like that.
Well, anyhow, they were having this spell down.
And, uh, I just fell down in a hurry.
And I was sitting here in the desk.
And they ended up with about five or six kids up front.
Because they'd all, we'd all be around the room at the start.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, she, uh, one of the girls wanted to go to the bathroom.
The bathroom wasn't in the school then.
It was a cesspool that was up on the hill away from the school of the ways.
A cesspool?
Yeah.
Oh, it was a terrific thing.
It wasn't just the school then.
It'd run over, it'd run over and run down towards the school.
And, uh, uh, she asked to go to the bathroom.
The teacher says, you'll have to sit down when you come back.
So she didn't want to sit down.
So she stayed up there.
And she wet her pants.
And then she, then she says, can I go out?
Yeah.
The teacher says then.
And then she took off and rent and, and that stuff, it was down, you know, from up front, down past my desk, and run under my desk.
Nobody mopped it up?
No.
No, there was a janitor at school.
He did it.
Was it all in one room?
What?
The school?
The classroom?
No, no.
This was town school.
Oh.
It's still standing, too.
I got a picture of it.
Yeah.
Um.
Um.
What was the name of that school?
UConn School.
No, I know.
There's a big school.
There's a slate roof on it.
Three stories.
There's the windows all busted out there.
Um.
It's just set there.
It's an old landmark.
Yeah.
They had two schools there.
One of them was stored out.
They had two schools.
The first one was only up to sixth grade.
They didn't have kindergarten there.
was stored out. They had two schools. The first one was only up to 6th grade. They didn't have
kindergarten there. And the other one was 4th to 8th. In third grade, a cousin of mine, Ms. Camel,
Elizabeth Camel. My grandmother said she was my cousin. She asked me who was my teacher, and I said Ms. Camel.
Oh, that's your cousin, she told me. I don't know how she got to be cousin. She didn't ever mention
herself. She asked me if I was relatives of the Bruners, and I said yes, and that was all she ever
mentioned about knowing anybody else. Well, tell about when your dad met Laura and how he married her,
or why he married her. Well, Pa used to go up to see old Dad Morgan. He liked old Dad Morgan. That was
your step-grandfather? Yeah. He'd go up to see him, and when he'd walk up past the reservoir,
uh, and, uh, up through a pasture, and then he'd go by his grand's place. And, uh, he'd stop and talk with
them, and even if he didn't see Laura, she was there. That's her house. Huh? That was her parents' house.
Yeah. And then he'd stop and talk with him, and then first thing you know, he got to liking Laura, I guess,
and she kind of liked him, although she wanted to marry somebody to get away from home.
How old was she? How old was she? 26. And, uh, she, uh, she had a boyfriend, but folks wouldn't let her get married.
She was just an owl. And, uh, anyhow, she, he got with her, and, uh,
uh, he'd stay up there till the day. They all went to bed with Laura. And, uh, and then they'd be peeking around.
They'd kill Billy. Yeah, so he didn't have no chance to be with her hardly any alone. Um, but anyhow,
he'd talk to her into running away from home to get married. And, uh, so. Did he tell you guys that he had a girlfriend?
Well, I kind of know, because one time he'd give me, uh, uh, a bill to get cash,
and devise something. He, he wanted to get cut down a little bit. It was too big a bill. It probably was,
maybe it was a $20 gold piece. Gold was circulating still there. Really?
Yeah. They paid in gold. Huh. And, uh, anyhow, I, uh, I went to get whatever I was supposed to do at the store,
and get that, broke down to smaller bit. Smaller. Were you supposed to get chocolate? No.
No. No. I didn't have them. Not that time? Uh-uh. I didn't get nothing like that. I don't remember
what else I was supposed to get. Well, anyhow, here I met him and her, and they were walking.
I met them, and they were going out toward Yukon. And, uh, and I had this money in my pocket,
and it was like her kid says. And, uh, she was rooting around, and she was watching me,
rooting around in my pocket to get all the change and the money. And, uh, funny, uh, I, I looked at,
I saw her, and that was the first time I'd seen her. You didn't think she was ugly? Well, I didn't
think anything about it. And then I went on home, and they went on. What did she look like? Oh,
she looked all right. And she was as good as her looks. She looked all right. Um, she, uh, then I, I didn't, I-
